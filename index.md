## Where to start
1. **Fundamental Principles** – These principles form the interpretive bedrock for every Kaharagian code. Begin here to understand how the Sovereign, the state, and the legal order relate, and how the other codes must be read in harmony with these articles.
2. **Civil Code** – Governs status, family, property, and obligations among private persons under the overarching Fundamental Principles.
3. **Criminal Code** – Defines offenses and penalties, applied subject to the limits and guarantees reflected in the Fundamental Principles.
4. **Codes of Procedure and Evidence** – Establish how civil and criminal matters are brought, heard, and proven in court, always interpreted consistently with the Fundamental Principles.

## Reading guidance
- Cross-references within articles point to related provisions in other codes; follow them to see how substantive and procedural rules interact.
- When in doubt about interpretation, consult the Fundamental Principles for guidance, as every code is issued under their authority.
- The numbering of articles follows their respective codes; the Fundamental Principles precede the Civil, Criminal, Procedural, and Evidence codes in hierarchy and interpretation.
