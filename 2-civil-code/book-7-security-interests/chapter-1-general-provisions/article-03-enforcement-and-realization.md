# Article 3 – Enforcement and Realization

1. Upon default by the debtor in payment or performance of the secured obligation, the secured creditor may enforce the security interest and realize upon the secured property in accordance with the provisions of this Book and the security agreement.

2. Default includes:
    a. failure to pay principal, interest, or other sums when due;
    b. breach of covenants or conditions of the security agreement;
    c. insolvency, bankruptcy, or commencement of liquidation proceedings against the debtor;
    d. material impairment of the secured property or of the secured creditor's security interest;
    e. such other events as are defined as default in the security agreement, provided they are reasonable and not contrary to law.

3. Before enforcing the security interest, the secured creditor must:
    a. give the debtor notice of default and an opportunity to cure within a reasonable period, unless immediate action is necessary to prevent loss or deterioration of the secured property;
    b. give notice to other secured creditors and interested parties, as required by law or the security agreement;
    c. comply with any procedural requirements imposed by law, regulation, or the security agreement.

4. Methods of enforcement include:
    a. judicial foreclosure or sale, by court order;
    b. private sale, if authorized by the security agreement and conducted in a commercially reasonable manner;
    c. appropriation of the secured property in satisfaction of the debt, with the consent of the debtor and junior creditors or by court order;
    d. appointment of a receiver to manage and dispose of the secured property.

5. The secured creditor has a duty to act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in enforcing the security interest and disposing of the secured property. This duty is owed to the debtor, to other secured creditors, and to other interested parties.

6. The secured property must be sold for a fair price. A sale is deemed commercially reasonable if:
    a. it is conducted after adequate notice and publicity;
    b. it is held at a time and place reasonably convenient for prospective purchasers;
    c. the property is sold for the best price obtainable in the circumstances;
    d. all applicable legal requirements are observed.

7. The debtor and other interested parties have the right to:
    a. redeem the secured property at any time before sale, by paying the entire secured obligation plus costs and expenses;
    b. object to the proposed method or terms of enforcement, by judicial challenge;
    c. purchase the secured property at the sale, on equal terms with other purchasers;
    d. receive an accounting of the proceeds and application thereof.

8. Proceeds of enforcement are applied in the following order:
    a. costs and expenses of enforcement, including legal fees, storage, and sale costs;
    b. the secured obligation, including principal, accrued interest, and default interest;
    c. junior security interests and other encumbrances, in order of priority;
    d. any surplus is returned to the debtor.

9. If the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the secured obligation, the secured creditor may pursue the debtor for the deficiency as an unsecured creditor, unless:
    a. the security agreement provides for non-recourse or limited recourse;
    b. the law limits deficiency claims for certain types of secured obligations;
    c. the secured creditor's conduct in enforcement was not commercially reasonable, which may bar or reduce the deficiency claim.

10. A secured creditor who violates the duty to act in a commercially reasonable manner is liable to the debtor and other interested parties for any loss caused by the violation, and may forfeit the right to claim a deficiency.

11. The debtor may waive the right to notice and the right to redeem, but such waiver is effective only if made after default. Pre-default waivers of these rights are void.

12. Enforcement of security interests is subject to protection of the debtor's essential property and basic needs:
    a. the debtor's primary residence is protected by homestead exemption, as provided in this Book;
    b. essential household goods, including basic furniture, appliances, clothing, and personal effects necessary for ordinary living, are exempt from execution;
    c. tools, equipment, and instruments necessary for the debtor's trade or profession, up to a reasonable value, are exempt;
    d. one motor vehicle necessary for employment or essential transportation, up to a reasonable value, is exempt;
    e. food, fuel, and provisions necessary for the debtor and their family for a reasonable period are exempt;
    f. amounts necessary for the debtor's basic subsistence and that of their dependents are protected from garnishment.

13. Wage garnishment and attachment of income are subject to strict limitations:
    a. the maximum amount subject to garnishment for consumer debts is twenty-five percent (25%) of disposable income, after deduction of taxes and essential living expenses;
    b. wages below 150% of the minimum wage are entirely exempt from garnishment;
    c. social benefits, pensions, unemployment compensation, and other social assistance payments are exempt from garnishment except for maintenance obligations and tax debts;
    d. garnishment orders must leave the debtor with sufficient income for basic necessities.

14. The debtor has the right to claim exemptions and object to enforcement actions that would deprive them of essential property or income. Courts must ensure that enforcement respects human dignity and does not render the debtor destitute.
