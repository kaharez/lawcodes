# Article 2 – Ranking and Priority

1. Security interests rank in priority according to the date and time of their establishment, registration, or perfection, as applicable. A security interest that is earlier in time has priority over a later security interest.

2. The priority rules applicable to each type of security interest are:
    a. for mortgages over immovable property, priority is determined by the date and time of registration in the land registry;
    b. for pledges over movable property, priority is determined by the date and time possession is delivered or, for non-possessory pledges, by the date of registration;
    c. for assignments of claims for security, priority is determined by the date notice is given to the debtor or the date of registration, whichever provides constructive notice to third parties.

3. Statutory privileges and liens arising by operation of law have priority over consensual security interests, except where the law expressly provides otherwise or the privilege or lien is subordinated by its nature.

4. Security interests securing future advances or revolving credit facilities rank from the date of the original security instrument, provided the instrument contemplates future advances and the maximum amount secured is specified.

5. A subordination agreement may alter the priority of security interests by agreement of the secured creditors. Subordination must be in writing and, for security interests requiring registration, must be registered to be effective against third parties.

6. A purchase-money security interest, being a security interest granted by the buyer to secure the unpaid purchase price of property, has priority over earlier security interests in the same property, provided:
    a. the purchase-money security interest is perfected contemporaneously with or immediately after the acquisition of the property;
    b. for movable property, notice is given to earlier secured creditors before or at the time of delivery;
    c. for immovable property, the purchase-money mortgage is registered before or simultaneously with the transfer of ownership.

7. Where multiple security interests have the same priority date, they rank equally and share pro rata in the proceeds of enforcement.

8. Priority extends to all obligations secured by the security interest, including principal, interest, costs, and expenses of enforcement, to the extent specified in the security instrument.

9. A secured creditor who advances funds or provides value without knowledge of a prior security interest acquires priority to the extent of the advance or value, if the secured creditor's security interest is perfected before the creditor obtains knowledge.

10. Priority of security interests is not affected by:
    a. subsequent transfers of ownership of the secured property, except where the transfer is to a bona fide purchaser in the ordinary course of business;
    b. subsequent bankruptcy or insolvency of the debtor, subject to special rules applicable in insolvency proceedings;
    c. consolidation or merger of secured obligations, provided the security interest continues to secure the consolidated obligation.

11. A secured creditor may release or waive priority as to specific property or as to specific obligations, without affecting the security interest or priority as to other property or obligations.

12. Disputes concerning priority of security interests are resolved by the court based on the evidence of establishment, perfection, and registration, and on principles of equity where the law does not provide clear rules.
