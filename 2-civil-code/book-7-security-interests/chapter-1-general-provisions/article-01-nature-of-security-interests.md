# Article 1 – Nature of Security Interests

1. A security interest is a real right granted over property to secure the performance of an obligation, conferring upon the creditor a preferential right to obtain satisfaction from the secured property.

2. Security interests may be established over:
    a. movable property, by way of pledge;
    b. immovable property, by way of mortgage;
    c. claims and intangible rights, by way of assignment for security.

3. Security interests are accessory to the principal obligation and follow its fate. They are extinguished automatically upon extinction of the principal obligation, unless otherwise provided.

4. A security interest may secure present or future obligations, provided the obligations are sufficiently determined or determinable.

5. Security interests confer upon the secured creditor:
    a. a right of preference, allowing them to be satisfied from the secured property in priority to unsecured creditors;
    b. a right of pursuit, allowing them to enforce the security against any person in possession of the secured property;
    c. a right to appropriate remedies upon default, including foreclosure or sale of the secured property.

6. Security interests must be established by written agreement and, in the case of immovable property, by notarial instrument. Registration or other formalities may be required for the security to be effective against third parties.

7. The secured creditor has a duty to preserve the secured property and may not use or dispose of it without the consent of the debtor, except as necessary for preservation or upon enforcement.

8. The debtor retains ownership of the secured property and may use and enjoy it in accordance with its nature, provided such use does not diminish its value or prejudice the rights of the secured creditor.

9. Security interests rank in priority according to the date of their establishment or registration. A later security interest is subordinate to an earlier one, except where the law grants priority to specific types of security.

10. Upon satisfaction of the secured obligation, the secured creditor must release the security and, where applicable, cancel any registration. Failure to do so may give rise to liability for damages.
