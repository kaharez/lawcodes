# Article 3 – Rights and Obligations of the Pledgor

1. The pledgor retains ownership of the pledged property, subject to the pledgee's possessory security interest. The pledgor may alienate or encumber the property, but such acts are subject to the pledge.

2. The pledgor has the right to:
    a. redeem the pledged property at any time by satisfying the secured obligation in full;
    b. receive periodic reports from the pledgee on the condition and status of the pledged property;
    c. inspect the property at reasonable times, without prejudice to the pledgee's possession;
    d. receive the fruits, revenues, and income produced by the property, unless otherwise agreed.

3. The pledgor must:
    a. pay all expenses of preservation, maintenance, insurance, and taxes relating to the pledged property;
    b. reimburse the pledgee for necessary expenses incurred on behalf of the pledgor;
    c. refrain from acts that impair the value or security of the pledge;
    d. notify the pledgee of any claims or proceedings affecting the property.

4. The pledgor may not demand return of the pledged property before the secured obligation is satisfied, except:
    a. if the pledgee uses the property without authorization or fails to preserve it with due care;
    b. if the pledgee becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to safeguard the property;
    c. by agreement with the pledgee to substitute equivalent security.

5. If the pledged property is in danger of perishing or deteriorating, the pledgor may:
    a. petition the court for authorization to sell the property and substitute the proceeds as security;
    b. demand that the pledgee take specific measures for preservation, at the pledgor's expense;
    c. provide substitute security and recover the original property.

6. The pledgor is entitled to any surplus proceeds from the sale of the pledged property after satisfaction of the secured obligation and all costs and expenses.

7. If the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to satisfy the secured obligation, the pledgor remains liable for the deficiency, unless the pledge agreement provides for non-recourse or the pledgor is released by law or agreement.

8. The pledgor may not, without the pledgee's consent:
    a. alter or transform the pledged property in a manner that affects its value or character;
    b. remove the property from the jurisdiction or place where it is held;
    c. grant additional security interests in the property that would impair the pledgee's priority.

9. If the pledgor alienates the pledged property to a third party, the pledge remains effective against the third party, and the pledgee retains possession. The third party acquires ownership subject to the pledge and may redeem the property by satisfying the secured obligation.

10. The pledgor has a duty to inform the pledgee of any facts or circumstances that may affect the value or security of the property, including claims, defects, or impending legal proceedings.

11. Upon satisfaction of the secured obligation, the pledgor is entitled to immediate return of the pledged property. If the pledgee delays without justification, the pledgor may seek judicial enforcement and claim damages.

12. The pledgor may challenge the pledgee's enforcement of the pledge if the pledgee fails to comply with legal requirements or acts in a commercially unreasonable manner. Such challenge may result in suspension of the sale and liability of the pledgee for damages.
