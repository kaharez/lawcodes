# Article 2 – Rights and Obligations of the Pledgee

1. The pledgee has the right to retain possession of the pledged property until the secured obligation is fully satisfied, including principal, interest, costs, and expenses.

2. The right of retention extends to all obligations of the pledgor to the pledgee, whether arising from the same transaction or from other transactions, provided the pledge agreement contemplates securing multiple obligations or the parties so agree.

3. The pledgee must:
    a. preserve the pledged property with the care and diligence of a prudent custodian;
    b. refrain from using or enjoying the property without the pledgor's consent, except as necessary for preservation;
    c. take reasonable measures to protect the property against loss, theft, or deterioration;
    d. insure the property against risks, if customary or required by the pledge agreement, at the pledgor's expense.

4. The pledgee is liable for loss or damage to the pledged property resulting from:
    a. the pledgee's fault, negligence, or willful misconduct;
    b. use of the property without authorization;
    c. failure to take measures a prudent person would take for preservation.

5. The pledgee is not liable for:
    a. loss or damage resulting from force majeure, acts of third parties, or inherent vice of the property, provided the pledgee exercised due care;
    b. depreciation or loss of value due to market conditions or ordinary wear and tear;
    c. expenses of preservation and maintenance, which are chargeable to the pledgor.

6. The pledgee has the right to be reimbursed for:
    a. necessary expenses incurred for preservation of the pledged property;
    b. taxes, charges, and insurance premiums paid on behalf of the pledgor;
    c. costs and expenses of enforcing the pledge, including legal fees and sale costs.

7. The pledgee may not use the pledged property or permit others to use it, except:
    a. with the express consent of the pledgor;
    b. where use is necessary for preservation of the property (e.g., operating machinery to prevent deterioration);
    c. where the pledge agreement expressly authorizes use, subject to accounting for the value of the use.

8. The pledgee has no right to appropriate the fruits, revenues, or income produced by the pledged property, unless:
    a. the pledge agreement expressly provides that such fruits shall be applied to the secured obligation;
    b. the fruits are inseparable from the property and cannot be delivered to the pledgor without prejudice to the pledge.

9. Upon satisfaction of the secured obligation, the pledgee must immediately return the pledged property to the pledgor or as the pledgor directs, in the condition it was received, subject to ordinary wear and tear.

10. If the pledgee wrongfully refuses to return the property after satisfaction of the obligation, the pledgee is liable for:
    a. any loss or damage suffered by the pledgor due to the delay;
    b. the value of the use of the property during the period of wrongful detention;
    c. such other damages as may be proven.

11. The pledgee may not sub-pledge or further encumber the pledged property without the consent of the pledgor, except where necessary to protect the pledgee's interest (e.g., to secure advances made for preservation).

12. If the pledged property consists of securities, financial instruments, or other intangible assets, the pledgee must exercise the rights attached thereto (such as voting rights or rights to receive distributions) in accordance with the pledgor's instructions or, in the absence of instructions, in a manner that preserves the value of the security.
