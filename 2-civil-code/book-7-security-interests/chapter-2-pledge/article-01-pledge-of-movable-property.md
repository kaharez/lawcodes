# Article 1 – Pledge of Movable Property

1. Pledge is a security interest over movable property, conferring upon the creditor a right to retain possession of the property and, upon default, to obtain satisfaction from its value.

2. Pledge may be established over corporeal movables, incorporeal rights, securities, and other movable assets capable of delivery or transfer.

3. Pledge requires:
    a. an agreement between the pledgor and pledgee, in writing;
    b. delivery of the pledged property to the pledgee or to a third party agreed upon by both parties;
    c. the pledgor's ownership or right to pledge the property.

4. The pledgee must preserve the pledged property with the care of a prudent custodian. The pledgee may not use the property without the consent of the pledgor, and must return it upon satisfaction of the secured obligation.

5. The fruits and revenues of the pledged property belong to the pledgor, unless otherwise agreed. If agreed, the pledgee may apply them to the secured obligation, first to expenses and interest, then to principal.

6. Upon default by the debtor, the pledgee may:
    a. demand judicial sale of the pledged property and obtain satisfaction from the proceeds;
    b. with the agreement of the pledgor or judicial authorization, appropriate the property at its fair market value in discharge of the debt.

7. Any agreement permitting the pledgee to appropriate the pledged property without judicial oversight or independent valuation is null and void (prohibition of pactum commissorium).

8. If the value of the pledged property exceeds the amount of the debt, the surplus is returned to the pledgor. If the value is insufficient, the pledgee may pursue the debtor for the deficiency as an unsecured creditor.

9. Pledge may be established without delivery (non-possessory pledge) over certain types of property, such as commercial inventory or equipment, subject to registration and special rules established by law.

10. The pledge is extinguished by:
    a. payment or satisfaction of the secured obligation;
    b. return of the pledged property to the pledgor with the intention to release the security;
    c. loss or destruction of the pledged property without fault of the pledgee;
    d. acquisition of the pledged property by the pledgee;
    e. prescription or other causes extinguishing the principal obligation.
