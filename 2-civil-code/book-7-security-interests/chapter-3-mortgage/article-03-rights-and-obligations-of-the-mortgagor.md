# Article 3 – Rights and Obligations of the Mortgagor

1. The mortgagor retains full ownership and possession of the mortgaged property and may continue to use and enjoy it in accordance with its nature and purpose, subject to the limitations imposed by the mortgage.

2. The mortgagor has the right to:
    a. occupy, use, and enjoy the mortgaged property;
    b. receive the fruits, revenues, and income produced by the property;
    c. make repairs, improvements, and alterations that do not diminish the value or security of the property;
    d. alienate or further encumber the property, subject to the mortgage and the rights of the mortgagee.

3. The mortgagor must:
    a. maintain the property in good condition and repair;
    b. pay all taxes, charges, and assessments imposed on the property;
    c. insure the property against fire, casualty, and other risks as required by the mortgage agreement or as is customary;
    d. refrain from committing waste or allowing the property to deteriorate.

4. The mortgagor may not:
    a. demolish or substantially alter the mortgaged property without the consent of the mortgagee, except as necessary for repair or preservation;
    b. remove fixtures or other items that are part of the immovable property;
    c. engage in activities that create environmental hazards or legal liabilities affecting the property;
    d. permit junior liens or encumbrances that would materially impair the mortgagee's security, if prohibited by the mortgage agreement.

5. If the mortgagor alienates the mortgaged property, the mortgage remains in effect against the property in the hands of the transferee. The transferee becomes owner subject to the mortgage and may:
    a. assume personal liability for the secured obligation, by agreement with the mortgagor and mortgagee;
    b. take subject to the mortgage without assuming personal liability, in which case the property alone is liable but the transferee is not personally liable for any deficiency.

6. The mortgagor remains personally liable for the secured obligation even after alienation of the property, unless released by the mortgagee or by operation of law.

7. If the mortgaged property is damaged, destroyed, or expropriated, the mortgagee's security interest extends to:
    a. insurance proceeds payable for the loss;
    b. compensation paid by third parties responsible for the damage;
    c. expropriation compensation or other amounts payable for taking of the property.

8. The mortgagor must notify the mortgagee immediately of any damage, destruction, expropriation, or other event materially affecting the property, and must cooperate in making insurance claims or pursuing compensation.

9. The mortgagor has the right to redeem the mortgaged property at any time before foreclosure sale by paying the entire secured obligation, including principal, accrued interest, costs, and expenses. This right may not be waived in advance.

10. If the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may accelerate the entire obligation and demand immediate payment, if the mortgage agreement so provides. The mortgagor then has a limited period to cure the default or to challenge the acceleration if it was wrongful.

11. The mortgagor may contest foreclosure proceedings if:
    a. the default alleged by the mortgagee did not occur or has been cured;
    b. the mortgagee failed to comply with notice requirements or other procedural safeguards;
    c. the amount claimed exceeds the actual debt;
    d. the foreclosure would be inequitable or disproportionate in the circumstances.

12. Upon satisfaction of the secured obligation, the mortgagor is entitled to immediate release of the mortgage. If the mortgagee fails to execute and register the release within a reasonable time, the mortgagor may seek judicial enforcement and claim damages for any loss.
