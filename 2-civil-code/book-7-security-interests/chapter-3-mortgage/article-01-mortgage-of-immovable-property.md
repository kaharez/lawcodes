# Article 1 – Mortgage of Immovable Property

1. Mortgage is a security interest over immovable property, conferring upon the creditor a right to obtain satisfaction from the property by judicial sale, without requiring delivery or possession.

2. Mortgage may be established over:
    a. land and buildings;
    b. immovable property by nature or destination;
    c. real rights over immovable property, such as usufruct or building rights;
    d. such other interests in immovable property as are capable of alienation.

3. Mortgage requires:
    a. an agreement executed by notarial instrument;
    b. registration in the land registry or other appropriate public register;
    c. the mortgagor's ownership or right to mortgage the property.

4. Mortgage may secure present or future obligations, including conditional or contingent obligations, provided they are sufficiently determined or determinable.

5. The mortgagor retains possession and use of the mortgaged property and may continue to enjoy its fruits and revenues. The mortgagor may not commit waste or allow the property to deteriorate to the prejudice of the mortgagee.

6. The mortgagor may alienate or further encumber the mortgaged property, but such acts do not affect the rights of the mortgagee, who retains the right to enforce the mortgage against any subsequent owner or encumbrancer.

7. Upon default, the mortgagee may institute foreclosure proceedings, seeking judicial authorization for the sale of the mortgaged property by public auction.

8. The proceeds of the foreclosure sale are applied:
    a. first, to the costs and expenses of the sale;
    b. second, to the amounts secured by the mortgage, including principal, interest, and costs;
    c. third, to junior mortgages and other encumbrances in order of priority;
    d. the surplus, if any, is returned to the mortgagor.

9. If the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the secured debt, the mortgagee may pursue the debtor for the deficiency as an unsecured creditor, subject to the following limitations:
    a. for mortgages on the debtor's primary residence, no deficiency judgment is permitted (anti-deficiency rule), and the mortgagee's sole remedy is foreclosure and sale of the property;
    b. for mortgages on investment or commercial property, deficiency judgments are permitted only if the foreclosure sale was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner and obtained a fair market price;
    c. deficiency judgments are limited to the difference between the debt and the fair market value of the property, not the foreclosure sale price, if the sale price was below market value due to distressed sale conditions;
    d. the mortgagee may not pursue a deficiency if the mortgage was expressly agreed to be non-recourse.

9A. Primary residences are protected by homestead exemption:
    a. a debtor's primary residence is exempt from execution and forced sale to satisfy unsecured debts, up to a value of two hundred thousand euros or such amount as established by law;
    b. the homestead exemption does not protect against foreclosure for mortgage debt secured by the primary residence itself, property taxes, or construction liens, but does protect against other creditors;
    c. the homestead exemption automatically applies and requires no formal declaration, but may be registered to provide notice to creditors;
    d. the exemption applies to the land and dwelling that serves as the family's permanent home, including a reasonable curtilage.

10. Mortgage is extinguished by:
    a. satisfaction of the secured obligation;
    b. release by the mortgagee, evidenced by a written instrument and registered;
    c. acquisition of the mortgaged property by the mortgagee (consolidation);
    d. expiry of the term, if the mortgage was granted for a fixed period;
    e. loss or total destruction of the mortgaged property;
    f. prescription of the secured obligation, subject to registration requirements.

11. Upon extinction of the mortgage, the mortgagee must execute a release and procure its registration. The mortgagor may compel registration by judicial decree if the mortgagee refuses without justification.
