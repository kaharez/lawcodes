# Article 4 – Rights and Obligations of the Mortgagee

1. The mortgagee has a security interest in the mortgaged property, conferring the right to foreclose and sell the property in satisfaction of the secured obligation upon default by the mortgagor.

2. The mortgagee has the right to:
    (a) demand payment of the secured obligation when due;
    (b) accelerate the obligation and demand immediate payment of the entire debt upon default, if the mortgage agreement so provides;
    (c) inspect the mortgaged property at reasonable times to verify its condition and compliance with the mortgage covenants;
    (d) enforce the mortgage by judicial foreclosure or other means permitted by law.

3. The mortgagee must:
    (a) act in good faith in all dealings with the mortgagor and in enforcement of the mortgage;
    (b) give the mortgagor reasonable notice of default and an opportunity to cure before commencing foreclosure;
    (c) conduct any foreclosure sale in a commercially reasonable manner;
    (d) account to the mortgagor for the proceeds of foreclosure and return any surplus.

4. The mortgagee may not:
    (a) appropriate the mortgaged property without judicial oversight or the consent of the mortgagor and junior creditors;
    (b) interfere with the mortgagor's use and enjoyment of the property, except as necessary to protect the security interest;
    (c) waive or release the mortgage without the consent of guarantors or other parties with an interest in maintaining the security.

5. Upon default, the mortgagee may:
    (a) institute foreclosure proceedings by judicial action;
    (b) petition the court for appointment of a receiver to manage the property and collect rents and revenues;
    (c) take conservatory measures to protect the property against waste, damage, or loss;
    (d) pursue the mortgagor personally for payment of the debt, independently of or in addition to foreclosure.

6. The mortgagee's security interest extends to:
    (a) the principal amount of the secured obligation;
    (b) interest accrued at the contractual rate, and default interest if provided;
    (c) costs and expenses of enforcement, including legal fees, court costs, and sale expenses;
    (d) such other amounts as are specified in the mortgage agreement or imposed by law.

7. The mortgagee has priority over unsecured creditors and over secured creditors with later mortgages or security interests. Priority is determined by the date of registration, subject to statutory exceptions for privileged claims (such as taxes, wages, and construction liens).

8. If the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may, with court authorization or under a power of sale clause, sell the mortgaged property. The sale must be:
    (a) conducted after adequate notice to the mortgagor, junior creditors, and other interested parties;
    (b) widely advertised to attract prospective purchasers and obtain a fair price;
    (c) held at a reasonable time and place;
    (d) conducted in accordance with all legal requirements and in a commercially reasonable manner.

9. The mortgagee may not purchase the mortgaged property at the foreclosure sale for their own account, except:
    (a) with the express consent of the mortgagor and junior creditors; or
    (b) by judicial authorization, upon proof that the sale was conducted fairly and the price is adequate.

10. After the foreclosure sale, the mortgagee must:
    (a) apply the proceeds first to costs and expenses, then to the secured obligation, and then to junior creditors in order of priority;
    (b) remit any surplus to the mortgagor within a reasonable time;
    (c) provide a full accounting of the sale and application of proceeds;
    (d) execute and deliver all documents necessary to transfer title to the purchaser.

11. If the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the secured obligation, the mortgagee may pursue the mortgagor for the deficiency, unless:
    (a) the mortgage agreement provides for non-recourse or limits recourse;
    (b) the mortgagee's conduct in the foreclosure was not commercially reasonable, which may bar or reduce the deficiency claim;
    (c) the mortgagor successfully challenges the sale on grounds of procedural irregularity or inadequate price.

12. Upon full satisfaction of the secured obligation, the mortgagee must execute and register a release of the mortgage. Failure to do so within a reasonable time after request may subject the mortgagee to liability for damages and to penalties imposed by law.

13. The mortgagee owes fiduciary-like duties to junior creditors and other interested parties, requiring the mortgagee to protect their interests in the course of enforcement and to account for proceeds in accordance with their respective priorities.
