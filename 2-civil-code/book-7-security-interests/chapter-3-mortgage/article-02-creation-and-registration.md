# Article 2 – Creation and Registration

1. A mortgage is created by written agreement between the mortgagor and mortgagee, executed in the form of a notarial instrument or other authentic act as required by law.

2. The mortgage agreement must specify:
    (a) the identity and domicile of the mortgagor and mortgagee;
    (b) a description of the secured obligation, including the principal amount, interest rate, maturity, and conditions;
    (c) a precise description of the mortgaged property, sufficient to identify it without ambiguity;
    (d) the maximum amount secured by the mortgage, if the obligation is revolving or variable;
    (e) any special conditions, covenants, or restrictions agreed by the parties.

3. The mortgagor must have ownership or another right capable of being mortgaged at the time of creation. A mortgage granted by a person who is not the owner is void, except where the mortgagor subsequently acquires ownership, in which case the mortgage becomes effective from the date of acquisition.

4. A mortgage must be registered in the land registry or other appropriate public register to be effective against third parties. Registration provides constructive notice to all persons.

5. The registration must include:
    (a) a copy or abstract of the mortgage agreement;
    (b) the legal description of the mortgaged property;
    (c) the amount and terms of the secured obligation;
    (d) the names and addresses of the parties;
    (e) such other information as may be required by law or regulation.

6. Priority of the mortgage is determined by the date and time of registration. A mortgage registered earlier in time has priority over a mortgage registered later, subject to statutory exceptions for privileged claims.

7. Registration is effected by submission of the required documents and payment of the prescribed fees. The registrar examines the documents for formal compliance and, if satisfied, enters the mortgage in the register.

8. A mortgage may secure present or future obligations, provided they are sufficiently determined or determinable. If the obligation is contingent or its amount is variable, the mortgage agreement must specify the maximum amount secured.

9. A mortgage may be granted to secure obligations of the mortgagor or of a third party. In the latter case, the mortgagor has recourse against the principal debtor for any loss suffered due to enforcement of the mortgage.

10. A co-owner of immovable property may mortgage their undivided share without the consent of other co-owners, but the mortgage affects only the mortgagor's share and any specific property attributed to them upon partition.

11. Registration of the mortgage remains effective until:
    (a) the secured obligation is satisfied and the mortgagee executes a release, which is registered;
    (b) the mortgage expires by its terms, if granted for a fixed period;
    (c) the mortgage is cancelled by court order or by operation of law;
    (d) the prescriptive period for the secured obligation expires and cancellation is registered.

12. Amendments, subordinations, and partial releases of the mortgage must be executed in the same form as the original mortgage and must be registered to be effective against third parties.

13. The mortgagor may register a notice of satisfaction or release if the mortgagee fails to do so after the obligation is satisfied. The mortgagor must provide evidence of satisfaction and give notice to the mortgagee. If the mortgagee does not object within a specified period, the registrar may cancel the registration.
