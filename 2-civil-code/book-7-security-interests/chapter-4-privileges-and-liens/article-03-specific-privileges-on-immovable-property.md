# Article 3 – Specific Privileges on Immovable Property

1. A privilege or lien on immovable property is a right granted by law to certain creditors to obtain payment from specific immovable property in priority to other creditors, by reason of the nature of their claim.

2. The vendor's privilege grants the seller of immovable property a lien for the unpaid purchase price, provided:
    (a) the privilege is expressly reserved in the deed of sale;
    (b) the deed is executed by notarial instrument;
    (c) the privilege is registered in the land registry within 30 days of the sale.

3. The vendor's privilege:
    (a) secures the unpaid balance of the purchase price and interest;
    (b) ranks in priority immediately after taxes and charges of the state;
    (c) continues until the price is paid or the privilege is released or extinguished;
    (d) may be enforced by judicial foreclosure in the same manner as a mortgage.

4. The builder's and architect's privilege grants persons who have contributed labour, materials, or services to the construction, repair, or improvement of immovable property a lien on that property for the value of their contribution.

5. The builder's and architect's privilege:
    (a) attaches to the immovable property to which the work was supplied;
    (b) secures the reasonable value of labour, materials, and services provided;
    (c) must be registered within 60 days of completion of the work or, if the work is unfinished, within 60 days of cessation of work;
    (d) ranks in priority after the vendor's privilege but before ordinary mortgages registered after commencement of the work.

6. Persons entitled to the builder's and architect's privilege include:
    (a) architects, engineers, and surveyors who provided plans or supervision;
    (b) contractors and subcontractors who performed construction or repair work;
    (c) suppliers of materials used in the construction or repair;
    (d) workers who provided labour.

7. To perfect the builder's and architect's privilege, the claimant must:
    (a) register a notice of claim in the land registry, specifying the nature and amount of the claim and describing the property;
    (b) give notice to the owner of the property;
    (c) commence judicial proceedings to enforce the privilege within six months of registration, failing which the privilege lapses.

8. The privilege for preservation or improvement grants a person who has preserved or improved immovable property at the request of the owner a lien for the reasonable cost of the work.

9. The privilege for preservation or improvement:
    (a) applies where the work prevented loss or damage or enhanced the value of the property;
    (b) must be registered promptly after completion of the work;
    (c) ranks in priority according to the benefit conferred on the property and on other creditors.

10. Privileges on immovable property are enforced by judicial foreclosure, in the same manner as mortgages. The procedure includes:
    (a) filing a petition with the court;
    (b) giving notice to the owner, other creditors, and interested parties;
    (c) obtaining a judgment declaring the privilege and authorizing sale of the property;
    (d) conducting a public sale and distributing proceeds according to the order of priority.

11. The ranking of privileges and other security interests on immovable property is generally:
    (a) taxes, charges, and other claims of the state;
    (b) judicial expenses incurred for the common benefit;
    (c) vendor's privilege for unpaid purchase price;
    (d) builder's and architect's privilege for construction or improvement;
    (e) mortgages, in order of registration;
    (f) other privileges, in order of registration or as provided by law;
    (g) unsecured claims of general creditors.

12. Privileges on immovable property are extinguished by:
    (a) payment or satisfaction of the secured claim;
    (b) release by the creditor, registered in the land registry;
    (c) expiry of the period for enforcement without judicial action;
    (d) sale of the property to a bona fide purchaser, if the privilege was not registered;
    (e) prescription of the underlying claim.

13. A creditor who asserts a privilege on immovable property after the property has been sold may, in certain cases, pursue the purchaser if the privilege was duly registered and the purchaser had notice. Otherwise, the creditor's recourse is limited to claiming against the proceeds of sale in the hands of the seller or against the seller personally.
