# Article 1 – Statutory Privileges and Liens

1. A privilege or lien is a right conferred by law upon a creditor to obtain satisfaction from specific property in priority to other creditors, by reason of the nature of the claim.

2. Privileges and liens arise by operation of law and do not require agreement or formalities, except as specifically provided.

3. General privileges affect all property of the debtor, both movable and immovable. Special privileges affect only specific property.

4. General privileges rank in the following order of priority:
    (a) judicial expenses incurred for the common benefit of creditors;
    (b) funeral expenses of the debtor;
    (c) expenses of the last illness;
    (d) wages and salaries of employees for the last six months of employment;
    (e) taxes and charges owed to the state.

5. Special privileges on movable property include:
    (a) unpaid seller's lien on the goods sold, as long as they remain in the possession of the buyer;
    (b) landlord's lien on movable property found on the leased premises, for unpaid rent;
    (c) repairer's lien on property repaired or improved, for the cost of repairs or improvements;
    (d) carrier's lien on goods transported, for unpaid freight charges;
    (e) depository's lien on property deposited, for unpaid charges.

6. Special privileges on immovable property include:
    (a) vendor's privilege for unpaid purchase price, if reserved by written instrument and registered;
    (b) builder's and architect's privilege for the value of construction or improvement, if registered within the prescribed period;
    (c) privileges for preservation or improvement of the property.

7. Special privileges rank before general privileges. Among special privileges, the order of priority is determined by specific rules or, in the absence thereof, by the date of registration or the date the claim arose.

8. A creditor holding a privilege or lien may enforce it by:
    (a) retention or detention of the property, where permitted;
    (b) judicial sale and satisfaction from the proceeds in priority to other creditors.

9. Privileges and liens are extinguished by:
    (a) satisfaction of the secured claim;
    (b) loss or destruction of the property;
    (c) voluntary release by the creditor;
    (d) prescription of the claim;
    (e) alienation of the property to a bona fide purchaser, where the privilege or lien was not registered or disclosed.

10. Where multiple creditors hold privileges or liens on the same property, the proceeds of sale are distributed according to the order of priority established by law. If privileges are of equal rank, distribution is pro rata.
