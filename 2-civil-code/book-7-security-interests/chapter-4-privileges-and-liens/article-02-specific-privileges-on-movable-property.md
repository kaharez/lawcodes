# Article 2 – Specific Privileges on Movable Property

1. A privilege or lien on movable property is a right granted by law to certain creditors to obtain payment from specific movable property in priority to other creditors, by reason of the nature of their claim.

2. The unpaid seller's privilege grants the seller a lien on goods sold and delivered to the buyer for the unpaid purchase price, provided:
    a. the goods remain in the possession of the buyer and can be identified;
    b. the buyer has not paid the price in full;
    c. the buyer has not resold the goods to a bona fide purchaser for value;
    d. the seller asserts the lien within a reasonable time, ordinarily within 30 days of delivery.

3. The landlord's privilege grants the landlord a lien on movable property of the tenant found on the leased premises for unpaid rent, charges, and damages, including rent for the current term and arrears not exceeding one year.

4. The landlord's lien:
    a. attaches to all movable property of the tenant on the premises, including furniture, goods, and equipment;
    b. does not extend to property belonging to third parties, unless the landlord reasonably believed it belonged to the tenant;
    c. may be exercised by retention of the property or by judicial sale;
    d. ranks in priority after certain privileged claims, such as wages and taxes.

5. The repairer's privilege grants a person who repairs, improves, or stores movable property a lien on that property for the reasonable cost of repairs, improvements, or storage.

6. The repairer's lien:
    a. attaches only to the specific property repaired, improved, or stored;
    b. continues as long as the repairer retains possession of the property;
    c. is lost if the repairer voluntarily relinquishes possession without reserving the lien;
    d. ranks in priority over earlier security interests if the repairs preserved or enhanced the value of the property.

7. The carrier's privilege grants a carrier a lien on goods transported for unpaid freight charges, including charges for storage and handling incidental to transportation.

8. The carrier's lien:
    a. attaches to the goods transported and continues while they remain in the carrier's possession;
    b. may be exercised by retention or by judicial sale after notice to the owner and consignee;
    c. ranks in priority over the rights of the consignor and consignee but may be subordinate to earlier security interests.

9. The depository's privilege grants a depository or warehouseman a lien on goods deposited for unpaid storage charges and expenses incurred for preservation of the goods.

10. The depository's lien:
    a. attaches to the specific goods deposited;
    b. continues as long as the depository retains possession;
    c. may be enforced by judicial sale after notice and expiry of a reasonable period for payment;
    d. ranks in priority after liens for preservation and improvement of the goods.

11. Privileges on movable property are exercised by:
    a. retention of possession of the property until payment;
    b. judicial sale, upon petition to the court and after notice to the owner and other interested parties;
    c. set-off against amounts owed by the creditor to the debtor, if permitted by law or agreement.

12. Privileges on movable property are extinguished by:
    a. payment or satisfaction of the secured claim;
    b. voluntary relinquishment of possession by the creditor without reservation;
    c. sale of the property to a bona fide purchaser in the ordinary course of business;
    d. prescription of the underlying claim;
    e. destruction or loss of the property.

13. A creditor asserting a privilege must prove:
    a. the nature and amount of the claim;
    b. that the claim arises from one of the privileged categories recognized by law;
    c. that the property is in the creditor's possession or was recently in possession;
    d. that procedural requirements for exercising the privilege have been met.
