# Article 2 – Housing Cooperatives

1. A housing cooperative is a legal person organized to provide housing for its members on a cooperative basis, in which members collectively own and control the housing and govern the cooperative democratically.

2. Housing cooperatives are established to:
    a. provide affordable, secure, and quality housing for members;
    b. remove housing from the speculative market and ensure long-term affordability;
    c. promote democratic participation, community, and mutual aid;
    d. build assets and wealth for members through collective ownership;
    e. foster social cohesion and sustainable communities.

3. Types of housing cooperatives include:
    a. equity cooperatives, in which members hold shares representing their unit and share in appreciation or depreciation;
    b. limited-equity cooperatives, in which resale prices and returns are capped to preserve affordability;
    c. leasehold cooperatives, in which the cooperative leases land from a community land trust or public authority and owns the buildings;
    d. rental cooperatives, in which members do not hold equity but collectively manage rental housing.

4. Membership in a housing cooperative:
    a. is open to all persons meeting reasonable eligibility criteria, without discrimination;
    b. carries one vote per member, regardless of the size or value of the unit occupied;
    c. entails rights to occupy a unit, participate in governance, and share in assets upon dissolution;
    d. requires payment of a membership fee or share price, which may be subsidized for low-income members.

5. Governance of housing cooperatives is democratic:
    a. members elect a board of directors or management committee by majority vote;
    b. major decisions, including amendments to bylaws, large expenditures, and sale of property, require approval by the membership;
    c. members have the right to participate in general meetings, access information, and hold officers accountable;
    d. cooperative bylaws and governance documents must ensure democratic control and prevent domination by managers or outside interests.

6. Financial structure of housing cooperatives:
    a. members pay a monthly housing charge covering operating costs, maintenance, debt service, and reserves;
    b. housing charges are set by the membership based on the cooperative's budget and are generally more affordable than market rents;
    c. members may be required to make capital contributions or pay special assessments for major repairs or improvements;
    d. the cooperative may finance construction or acquisition through cooperative banks, public loans, or member contributions.

7. Limited-equity cooperatives restrict resale prices and returns to preserve affordability:
    a. upon departure, a member receives their initial investment plus a limited return, typically indexed to inflation or a fixed percentage;
    b. the cooperative has a right of first refusal to purchase the departing member's share at the restricted price;
    c. if the cooperative does not exercise its right, the share must be sold to an eligible purchaser at the restricted price;
    d. these restrictions are enforceable through the cooperative's bylaws, deed restrictions, or agreements with public authorities.

8. The state supports housing cooperatives through:
    a. favourable legal treatment, including simplified incorporation, tax exemptions, and regulatory support;
    b. financial assistance, including subsidized loans, grants, and loan guarantees for acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation;
    c. technical assistance and training for cooperative members and managers;
    d. priority access to public land and buildings for cooperative development;
    e. preference in public housing programs and subsidies.

9. Members of housing cooperatives enjoy:
    a. long-term security of tenure, with the right to occupy their unit as long as they fulfill membership obligations;
    b. protection against arbitrary eviction, with eviction permitted only for serious breach of cooperative rules and after fair procedures;
    c. the right to transfer or bequeath their membership and unit, subject to cooperative approval and transfer restrictions;
    d. participation in decision-making and control over their living environment.

10. Housing cooperatives are subject to:
    a. cooperative law and principles, including democratic control, open membership, and concern for community;
    b. requirements to maintain adequate reserves, insure property, and comply with building codes and safety regulations;
    c. periodic audits and reporting to ensure financial stability and compliance with laws;
    d. dispute resolution mechanisms, including mediation and arbitration, to resolve conflicts among members or between members and the cooperative.

11. Conversion of rental housing to cooperative ownership:
    a. is permitted and encouraged as a means of preserving affordability and empowering tenants;
    b. requires notice to tenants, opportunity to participate in the conversion, and protection of tenant rights;
    c. may be initiated by tenants, by the landlord with tenant approval, or by the state through facilitation and financing;
    d. must ensure that low- and moderate-income tenants are not displaced and can afford to participate.

12. Federations and networks of housing cooperatives provide mutual support, advocacy, training, and financing, strengthening the cooperative housing sector and promoting best practices.
