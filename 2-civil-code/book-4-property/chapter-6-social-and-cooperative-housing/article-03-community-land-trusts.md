# Article 3 – Community Land Trusts

1. A community land trust is a nonprofit legal person that acquires and holds land for the benefit of a community, providing secure, affordable access to land and housing in perpetuity by separating ownership of land from ownership of buildings and improvements.

2. Community land trusts are established to:
    (a) remove land from the speculative market and ensure permanent affordability;
    (b) provide affordable housing, commercial space, and community facilities;
    (c) preserve community assets and prevent displacement;
    (d) empower residents to control their living and working environment;
    (e) promote sustainable development and stewardship of land;
    (f) build community wealth and prevent gentrification.

3. Structure and governance of community land trusts:
    (a) the land trust owns the land and retains it in perpetuity for community benefit;
    (b) residents lease the land from the trust under long-term, inheritable, and transferable ground leases (typically 99 years, renewable);
    (c) residents own the buildings and improvements on the land, which they may sell subject to restrictions;
    (d) governance is tripartite, with representation from residents who lease land from the trust, neighbors and community members, and public interest representatives, ensuring accountability to the community.

4. Affordability and resale restrictions:
    (a) ground leases include resale formulas that limit the resale price of buildings, ensuring affordability for future purchasers;
    (b) resale prices are typically calculated as the initial price plus the cost of capital improvements, plus a limited return indexed to inflation or a fixed percentage, minus depreciation;
    (c) the community land trust has a right of first refusal to purchase buildings at the resale price, ensuring they remain available to eligible households;
    (d) these restrictions run with the land and are enforceable through the ground lease and deed restrictions, binding future owners.

5. Benefits to residents:
    (a) access to homeownership or secure tenancy at permanently affordable prices;
    (b) long-term security of tenure through inheritable and transferable ground leases;
    (c) protection from displacement and speculation;
    (d) ability to build equity and wealth through ownership of buildings and limited appreciation;
    (e) participation in democratic governance and community decision-making;
    (f) access to community programs, support services, and stewardship.

6. Acquisition of land by community land trusts:
    (a) purchase or donation from private owners, often motivated by desire to preserve affordability and community benefit;
    (b) grant or long-term lease from public authorities, recognizing the public interest in affordable housing and community development;
    (c) acquisition of vacant, abandoned, or tax-delinquent properties;
    (d) donation or transfer from nonprofit organizations, religious institutions, or community groups;
    (e) funding from public subsidies, philanthropic grants, and community contributions.

7. The state supports community land trusts through:
    (a) legal recognition and favourable treatment, including tax exemptions, regulatory flexibility, and simplified procedures;
    (b) grants, subsidized loans, and loan guarantees for land acquisition and development;
    (c) transfer or lease of public land at nominal cost for community land trust development;
    (d) technical assistance, training, and capacity building for community land trust organizers and staff;
    (e) preference in affordable housing programs and allocation of subsidies.

8. Ground leases issued by community land trusts:
    (a) are long-term (typically 99 years), renewable, and may be inherited or transferred to eligible purchasers;
    (b) require payment of a ground lease fee, typically set at a nominal amount to cover administrative costs;
    (c) include affordability covenants, resale restrictions, and use restrictions ensuring community benefit;
    (d) provide security of tenure, with termination permitted only for serious breach, after notice and opportunity to cure;
    (e) may be recorded in the land registry to provide notice and protection.

9. Community land trusts may hold land for diverse uses:
    (a) residential housing, including single-family homes, cooperatives, and multifamily rental housing;
    (b) commercial and retail space for local businesses and social enterprises;
    (c) community facilities, including gardens, parks, cultural centers, and childcare facilities;
    (d) agricultural land for urban farming, community gardens, and food security;
    (e) conservation land for environmental protection and open space.

10. Financing for homeownership on community land trust land:
    (a) mortgages are available from cooperative banks, public lenders, and socially responsible financial institutions that recognise the value of leasehold ownership;
    (b) the state may provide loan guarantees or subsidies to facilitate access to financing;
    (c) the community land trust may subordinate its ground lease to the mortgage, allowing the lender a security interest;
    (d) resale restrictions and affordability covenants are maintained, ensuring the lender's security while preserving community benefit.

11. Community land trusts have a duty to:
    (a) steward the land for long-term community benefit and affordability;
    (b) maintain democratic governance and accountability to residents and the community;
    (c) enforce resale restrictions and affordability covenants fairly and consistently;
    (d) provide support and resources to leaseholders, including financial counseling, maintenance assistance, and dispute resolution;
    (e) expand and preserve the stock of community-controlled land.

12. Community land trusts may collaborate and federate to share resources, best practices, and advocacy, strengthening the community land trust movement and promoting equitable development.

13. Community land trusts provide a proven model for permanently affordable housing, community empowerment, and prevention of displacement, and shall receive strong public support and promotion as a key strategy for realizing the right to housing.
