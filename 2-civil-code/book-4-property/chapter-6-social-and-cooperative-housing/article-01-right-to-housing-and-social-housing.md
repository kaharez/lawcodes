# Article 1 – Right to Housing and Social Housing

1. Adequate housing is a fundamental social right. Every person has the right to access safe, secure, habitable, and affordable housing appropriate to their needs and resources.

2. The state has a duty to progressively realize the right to housing by:
    (a) ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing through public construction, subsidies, and regulation of the housing market;
    (b) providing social housing for persons who cannot afford market-rate housing;
    (c) preventing homelessness and providing emergency shelter and transitional housing;
    (d) regulating rents and protecting tenants from exploitation and arbitrary eviction;
    (e) combating housing discrimination and ensuring equal access to housing;
    (f) promoting diverse forms of housing tenure, including social rental, cooperative ownership, and community land trusts.

3. Social housing is publicly owned or subsidized housing provided at below-market rents to low- and moderate-income households, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.

4. Social housing must:
    (a) meet standards of quality, habitability, and dignity equivalent to private housing;
    (b) be integrated within communities and not segregated or stigmatized;
    (c) be managed in a manner that respects tenant rights and promotes tenant participation;
    (d) provide long-term security of tenure, with eviction permitted only for just cause.

5. Eligibility for social housing is determined by:
    (a) household income, prioritizing lower-income households;
    (b) housing need, including inadequate current housing, overcrowding, or homelessness;
    (c) household composition, prioritizing families with children, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities;
    (d) residence and connection to the community;
    (e) absence of alternative adequate and affordable housing;
    (f) special circumstances, including domestic violence, health needs, or displacement.

6. Allocation of social housing must be:
    (a) transparent, with clear eligibility criteria and allocation procedures published and accessible;
    (b) fair and non-discriminatory, without regard to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or other prohibited grounds;
    (c) based on objective assessment of need and priority;
    (d) subject to appeal and review by independent bodies.

7. Rents for social housing are set at affordable levels, generally not exceeding twenty-five to thirty percent of household income, and are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in income and costs.

8. Tenants of social housing have the same fundamental rights as private tenants, including:
    (a) security of tenure and protection against arbitrary eviction;
    (b) habitability and maintenance of the dwelling;
    (c) privacy and peaceful enjoyment;
    (d) participation in decisions affecting their housing through tenant councils and consultations;
    (e) the right to modify and personalize their dwelling, within reasonable limits.

9. Tenants of social housing may, after a period of residence (typically five years), have the option to purchase their dwelling at a discounted price, subject to conditions that:
    (a) preserve the social housing stock by requiring resale restrictions or shared equity arrangements;
    (b) ensure that the benefit of public subsidy is retained for future generations;
    (c) provide for repayment of discounts if the property is sold within a specified period.

10. The state shall maintain and expand the stock of social housing to meet demand, through:
    (a) direct public construction and acquisition;
    (b) partnerships with nonprofit housing associations and cooperatives;
    (c) inclusionary zoning requiring private developers to include affordable units in new developments;
    (d) acquisition of vacant or underused properties for conversion to social housing;
    (e) regulation of short-term rentals and conversion of housing to commercial use, to preserve residential stock.

11. Funding for social housing comes from:
    (a) general taxation and public budgets;
    (b) dedicated housing funds financed by levies on property transactions, vacant properties, or luxury housing;
    (c) rents paid by social housing tenants, reinvested in maintenance and new construction;
    (d) proceeds from right-to-buy sales, with restrictions ensuring reinvestment in social housing.

12. Private landlords who receive public subsidies or tax benefits must comply with affordability requirements, tenant protections, and quality standards equivalent to social housing.

13. Homelessness is a violation of human dignity. The state has a duty to provide emergency shelter, transitional housing, and support services to persons experiencing homelessness, with the goal of rapid rehousing in permanent accommodation.

14. Housing policy and social housing management shall promote social cohesion, mixed-income communities, and integration of diverse populations, avoiding concentration of poverty or social exclusion.
