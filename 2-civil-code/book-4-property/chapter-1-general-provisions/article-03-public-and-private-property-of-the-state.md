# Article 3 – Public and Private Property of the State

1. All property designated as belonging to the state, whether sovereign domain, public domain, or private domain of the State, is vested in the Sovereign personally. The Sovereign holds this property in the Sovereign's capacity as the embodiment and personification of the state, exercising dominion over it for the benefit of the nation and in accordance with the constitutional traditions of Kaharagia.

2. The sovereign domain comprises the inalienable and imprescriptible symbols, prerogatives, titles, and honours vested exclusively in the Sovereign, including:
    a. the Crown and other sovereign regalia;
    b. heraldic emblems, the flag, and other symbols of the state;
    c. the prerogatives of sovereignty, including the power to grant honours, titles, and dignities;
    d. the archives and official registers of the state.

3. The public domain comprises property held by the Sovereign for the state and dedicated to public use or service, including:
    a. public registers and official records;
    b. property designated by law or decree as serving a public function;
    c. property acquired by the state for the fulfilment of its sovereign or administrative purposes.

4. Property of the public domain is inalienable and imprescriptible while it retains its public character. It may be removed from the public domain only by sovereign decree, upon which it becomes private property of the Sovereign held in the Sovereign's private capacity.

5. The private domain of the State comprises all property belonging to the Sovereign in the Sovereign's private capacity that does not form part of the sovereign or public domain. Such property is governed by the ordinary rules of private law and may be alienated, encumbered, or administered in the manner provided by law or decree.

6. Rights over property of the sovereign or public domain may not be acquired by prescription, adverse possession, or any other means inconsistent with its public character.

7. The administration and disposition of property of the state, whether sovereign, public, or private, is entrusted to the organs designated by law or sovereign decree and remains subject to the ultimate oversight and authority of the Sovereign.

8. Foreign states and international organisations may hold property within the jurisdiction of the state in accordance with international law and treaties to which Kaharagia is party.
