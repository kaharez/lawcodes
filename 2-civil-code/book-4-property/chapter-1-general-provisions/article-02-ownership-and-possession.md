# Article 2 – Ownership and Possession

1. Ownership is the fullest real right recognised under the laws of the state, conferring upon the owner the right to use, enjoy, and dispose of property, subject to the limitations imposed by law, public order, or the rights of others. Property entails social obligations and shall be used in a manner that serves the common good and respects environmental sustainability.

2. Environmental duties, animal welfare obligations, and sustainable use requirements established in Chapters 7 and 8 of this Book supersede and limit the exercise of property rights. Where there is a conflict between property rights and environmental protection or animal welfare, the environmental or welfare obligations shall prevail, subject to fair compensation where expropriation or significant restriction of use occurs for public purposes.

3. Subject to paragraphs 1 and 2 above, the owner may exercise all rights over the property, including:
    (a) the right to possess, occupy, and use the property;
    (b) the right to enjoy the fruits and revenues produced by the property;
    (c) the right to transform, improve, or alter the property;
    (d) the right to alienate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the property.

4. Ownership may be held:
    (a) individually by a single person;
    (b) jointly by multiple persons in undivided shares (co-ownership);
    (c) subject to limited real rights in favour of others, such as usufruct or servitude.

5. Possession is the exercise of physical control over property, whether by the owner or another person, with the intention to hold it as one's own or on behalf of another.

6. Possession is protected by law independently of ownership. A possessor in good faith who is disturbed or dispossessed may seek judicial protection, even against the owner, in accordance with the procedural laws of the state.

7. Continuous, peaceful, public, and unequivocal possession of property for the period prescribed by law may confer ownership by prescription, subject to the conditions established in subsequent provisions.

8. Ownership and possession of immovable property are governed by the laws of the place where the immovable is situated. Ownership and possession of movable property are governed by the laws of the state or, where applicable, the law of the place where the movable is situated.

9. Owners of productive property have a duty to use it in a manner that contributes to employment, economic development, and social welfare. Prolonged non-use or abandonment of productive property may result in measures to promote productive use, as provided by law.

10. Owners of land and buildings must respect environmental protection laws, maintain ecological balance, and prevent pollution or degradation of natural resources. Use of property that causes significant environmental harm may be restricted or prohibited, in accordance with Chapter 7 of this Book.

11. Expropriation of property for public use or social purposes is permitted with fair compensation, as provided by law. Social housing, land reform, environmental protection, animal welfare, and infrastructure development constitute legitimate grounds for expropriation in the public interest. Compensation shall reflect fair market value but may be reduced where the property was used in violation of environmental or animal welfare duties.
