# Article 1 – Definition and Classification of Property

1. Property, in the legal sense, consists of all things, rights, and interests that are capable of ownership, possession, or enjoyment under the laws of the state.

2. Property is classified as:
    a. movable or immovable property;
    b. corporeal or incorporeal property;
    c. property of the state or private property.

3. Immovable property includes:
    a. land and buildings permanently attached thereto;
    b. rights over immovable property, including servitudes and building rights;
    c. such other things as are declared immovable by law or sovereign decree.

4. Movable property includes all property that is not immovable, including:
    a. tangible objects capable of being moved;
    b. incorporeal rights not attached to immovable property;
    c. intellectual property rights, securities, and negotiable instruments.

5. Corporeal property consists of physical things that can be touched and moved, whether movable or immovable.

6. Incorporeal property consists of rights and interests that have economic value but lack physical form, including intellectual property, contractual rights, and real rights over property belonging to another.

7. Property of the state includes:
    a. sovereign domain, comprising symbols, prerogatives, and honours belonging exclusively to the Sovereign;
    b. public domain, comprising property dedicated to public use or service;
    c. private domain of the State, comprising property held by the state in a private capacity.

8. All other property is private property, belonging to natural persons, juridical persons, or foreign states.
