# Article 3 – Rights and Obligations of Co-owners

1. Each co-owner has the right to use and enjoy the entire property in accordance with its nature, provided such use does not prejudice the rights of the other co-owners.

2. Each co-owner is entitled to a share of the fruits, revenues, and benefits produced by the property in proportion to their share.

3. Each co-owner is obliged to contribute to the expenses of preservation, maintenance, and administration of the property in proportion to their share, unless otherwise agreed.

4. A co-owner who incurs necessary expenses for the preservation of the property is entitled to reimbursement from the other co-owners in proportion to their shares.

5. Decisions concerning the administration and ordinary use of the property require the consent of a majority of co-owners representing more than half of the shares.

6. Decisions concerning extraordinary administration, substantial alteration, or acts of disposition require:
    (a) the unanimous consent of all co-owners; or
    (b) judicial authorisation upon petition of co-owners representing a majority of the shares, where refusal by other co-owners is unreasonable.

7. A co-owner may not make alterations to the property without the consent of the other co-owners, unless the alteration is necessary for preservation or maintenance.

8. Any co-owner may demand an accounting of the administration of the property and inspect records pertaining to the co-ownership.
