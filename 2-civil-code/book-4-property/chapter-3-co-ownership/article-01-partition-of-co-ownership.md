# Article 1 – Partition of Co-ownership

1. No co-owner may be compelled to remain in co-ownership. Any co-owner may at any time demand partition of the property, unless:
    (a) partition has been excluded by agreement for a specified period not exceeding ten years, renewable by further agreement;
    (b) partition is prohibited by law or the nature of the property;
    (c) the property is indivisible by its nature or destination, and partition would render it unfit for its intended use.

2. Partition may be effected:
    (a) by agreement among all co-owners;
    (b) by judicial decree, upon petition of one or more co-owners.

3. Where partition in kind is possible without diminishing the value of the property or prejudicing the rights of co-owners, the property shall be divided into portions corresponding to the shares of each co-owner.

4. Where partition in kind is not possible or would result in significant diminution of value, the property shall be sold and the proceeds distributed among the co-owners in proportion to their shares.

5. A co-owner who has made improvements to the property at their own expense is entitled to compensation or removal of the improvements, as determined by the court, unless the improvements were made without consent and in bad faith.

6. A co-owner who has exclusively possessed or enjoyed the property beyond their share must compensate the other co-owners for their exclusion, unless prescription or another lawful ground justifies the exclusive possession.

7. Upon partition, each co-owner is deemed to have been the sole owner of the property or share allotted to them from the commencement of co-ownership, and never to have owned any other part.

8. Co-owners owe each other mutual warranties against eviction and hidden defects in the portions allotted, in proportion to their respective shares.
