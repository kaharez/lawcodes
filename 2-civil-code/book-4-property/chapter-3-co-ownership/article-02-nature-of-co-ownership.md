# Article 2 – Nature of Co-ownership

1. Co-ownership exists when ownership of property is held by two or more persons simultaneously in undivided shares.

2. Each co-owner holds a share in the entire property, not ownership of a specific physical part. The share may be equal or unequal, as determined by the title creating the co-ownership or, in the absence thereof, presumed to be equal.

3. Each co-owner may freely alienate, encumber, or bequeath their share, subject to any applicable rights of pre-emption in favour of the other co-owners.

4. The alienation or encumbrance of a share does not affect the rights of the other co-owners, except as provided by law or agreement.

5. Co-ownership may arise from:
    a. contract or juridical act;
    b. succession, where multiple heirs inherit the same property;
    c. operation of law;
    d. other causes recognised by law.

6. Co-ownership continues until terminated by partition, consolidation of all shares in a single owner, or loss or destruction of the property.
