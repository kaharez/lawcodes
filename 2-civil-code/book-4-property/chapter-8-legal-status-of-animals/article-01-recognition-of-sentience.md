# Article 1 – Recognition of Sentience

1. Non-human animals are recognised as sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, suffering, and well-being.

2. Animals are not "things" in the ordinary sense of property law, and the provisions governing property are subject to the recognition of animal sentience and the duties of care imposed by this Chapter.

3. Notwithstanding the recognition of sentience, animals may be owned, possessed, transferred, and inherited as property for the purposes of establishing legal ownership, inheritance rights, and enforcement of property-related criminal offences. However, the exercise of property rights over animals is subject to and limited by the duties of care and welfare obligations established in this Chapter and the Criminal Code.

4. Ownership or possession of an animal imposes a duty of care upon the owner or keeper to respect the animal's sentience and to provide for its welfare in accordance with this Code and applicable regulations.

5. Where there is a conflict between the exercise of property rights over an animal and the welfare of the animal, the welfare of the animal shall prevail. Property rights do not authorize cruelty, neglect, or violation of duties established by law.

6. This Chapter applies to all animals kept, owned, or controlled by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the State, whether domestic animals, agricultural animals, animals kept for commercial purposes, or animals in captivity.

7. Wild animals in their natural state are not subject to the ownership provisions of this Chapter, but persons who interact with, capture, or otherwise affect wild animals remain subject to duties imposed by law to avoid unnecessary suffering.
