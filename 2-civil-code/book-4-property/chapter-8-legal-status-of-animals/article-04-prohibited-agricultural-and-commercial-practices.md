# Article 4 – Prohibited Agricultural and Commercial Practices

1. The following agricultural and commercial practices involving animals are prohibited as inconsistent with the recognition of animal sentience and the duty to prevent unnecessary suffering:

## Battery Cages and Intensive Confinement

2. Battery cages and similar intensive confinement systems that prevent animals from engaging in natural behaviours and cause unnecessary suffering are prohibited for all animals, including but not limited to:
    a. battery cages for poultry (hens, chickens, quail, and other birds);
    b. gestation crates and farrowing crates for pigs;
    c. veal crates and individual calf confinement systems;
    d. any confinement system that:
    i. prevents the animal from standing, turning around, lying down, or stretching limbs fully;
    ii. prevents the animal from engaging in natural behaviours essential to well-being;
    iii. causes physical injury, deformity, or chronic stress;
    iv. provides inadequate space as determined by species-specific welfare standards; or
    v. is otherwise inconsistent with animal welfare principles.

3. All agricultural animals must be provided with:
    a. adequate space to move freely and engage in natural behaviours;
    b. appropriate environmental enrichment;
    c. access to outdoor areas or natural light where appropriate to the species;
    d. social contact with other animals of the same species where appropriate; and
    e. conditions that respect the animal's physiological and behavioural needs.

## Prohibited Mutilations and Alterations

4. The following procedures on agricultural animals are prohibited except where performed by a qualified veterinarian for documented therapeutic medical necessity:
    a. beak trimming, beak cutting, or debeaking of poultry for any purpose, including prevention of pecking behaviour that results from inadequate housing or management;
    b. tail docking of pigs, cattle, sheep, or any other animals, except where medically necessary to treat injury or disease;
    c. tooth clipping or grinding in piglets, except where medically necessary;
    d. castration without appropriate anaesthesia and analgesia;
    e. dehorning or disbudding without appropriate anaesthesia and analgesia;
    f. any cosmetic or convenience procedure that causes pain or suffering; or
    g. any other mutilation designated as prohibited by Sovereign Decree.

5. Where welfare concerns arise from management practices that would otherwise require mutilation (such as feather pecking), the management practices must be modified to address the underlying cause rather than resorting to mutilation.

## Chick Culling and Live Maceration

6. The following practices involving newly hatched birds are prohibited:
    a. killing of day-old male chicks by maceration, gassing, suffocation, or any other method (chick culling);
    b. killing of newly hatched birds due to sex, breed, or commercial considerations;
    c. live maceration or grinding of any birds;
    d. any method of killing young birds that is not immediately humane and painless; or
    e. disposal of live birds as waste.

7. The egg and poultry industries must:
    a. implement in-ovo sexing technology or other methods to determine sex before hatching;
    b. develop dual-purpose breeds that are commercially viable for both egg and meat production;
    c. ensure humane euthanasia methods are used where killing is unavoidable; and
    d. comply with any transitional regulations and timelines established by Sovereign Decree.
