# Article 2 – Duty of Care

1. Every person who owns, possesses, or has charge of an animal owes a duty of care to that animal and must take all reasonable steps to ensure the animal's welfare.

2. The duty of care includes the obligation to provide:
    (a) adequate and appropriate food and clean water suitable to the animal's species, age, and health;
    (b) appropriate shelter, housing, and environment that protects the animal from weather, predators, and hazards, and allows for natural behaviours appropriate to the species;
    (c) necessary veterinary care and medical treatment for illness, injury, or disease;
    (d) protection from cruelty, abuse, neglect, and avoidable pain or suffering;
    (e) appropriate space, exercise, and social interaction suitable to the animal's species and needs; and
    (f) humane treatment consistent with the animal's sentience and dignity.

3. Owners and keepers must not subject animals to:
    (a) unnecessary pain, suffering, or distress;
    (b) cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment;
    (c) conditions that cause severe physical or psychological harm;
    (d) procedures or practices prohibited by law or regulation; or
    (e) abandonment without adequate provision for care.

4. Where an owner or keeper is unable or unwilling to fulfil the duty of care, they must make appropriate arrangements for the animal's care or transfer the animal to a person capable of providing proper care.

5. Failure to fulfil the duty of care may result in:
    (a) civil liability for harm caused to the animal;
    (b) removal of the animal by competent authorities;
    (c) prohibition from keeping animals;
    (d) criminal liability under Book V, Chapter 6 of the Criminal Code; or
    (e) any other remedy or sanction provided by law.

6. The specific standards of care for different species, purposes, and circumstances may be further defined by regulation, professional standards, or Sovereign Decree.

7. Persons engaged in animal husbandry, veterinary practice, animal research, or other professional activities involving animals must adhere to professional standards and best practices in addition to the general duty of care.
