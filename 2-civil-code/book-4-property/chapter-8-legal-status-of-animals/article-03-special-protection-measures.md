    (c) animals used in research, testing, or scientific procedures;
    (d) animals used for agricultural or commercial purposes;
    (e) animals used for entertainment, display, or sport;
    (f) companion animals and domestic pets; or
    (g) any other category of animals requiring special consideration.

2. Special protection measures may include:
    (a) prohibition or restriction of certain practices, procedures, or uses;
    (b) licensing, registration, or qualification requirements for keeping, breeding, or working with particular species;
    (c) enhanced standards of care, housing, or treatment;
    (d) mandatory veterinary oversight or regular inspections;
    (e) restrictions on breeding, sale, import, or export;
    (f) prohibition of ownership or keeping by certain persons or in certain circumstances; or
    (g) any other measure necessary to protect animal welfare.

3. Regulations may establish:

    (d) requirements for professional qualification and licensing in animal-related professions; and
    (e) enforcement mechanisms and inspection regimes.

4. The prohibition or restriction of traditional, cultural, or religious practices involving animals shall be determined by Sovereign Decree, taking into account:
    (a) the degree of suffering or harm caused to animals;
    (b) the availability of alternative practices that reduce suffering;
    (c) international standards and obligations;
    (d) the importance of the practice to the community; and
    (e) the broader public interest in animal welfare.

5. Local authorities may, within the scope of their competence and subject to higher regulation, establish additional measures for animal welfare, including licensing schemes, breeding restrictions, and local enforcement measures.

6. Any person who violates special protection measures established by Sovereign Decree or regulation is subject to:
    (a) civil penalties and removal of animals;
    (b) criminal liability under the Criminal Code where the violation constitutes an offence; and
    (c) professional sanctions where applicable.
