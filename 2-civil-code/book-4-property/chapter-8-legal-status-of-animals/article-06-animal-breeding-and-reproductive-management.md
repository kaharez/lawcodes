# Article 6 – Animal Breeding and Reproductive Management

## Policy and Purpose

1. The State promotes responsible animal ownership and breeding practices, including the spaying and neutering of companion animals, to:
    a. prevent animal overpopulation and abandonment;
    b. reduce euthanasia of unwanted animals;
    c. improve animal health and welfare;
    d. prevent uncontrolled breeding and genetic disorders;
    e. reduce behavioural problems associated with intact animals;
    f. support animal welfare and public health objectives; and
    g. ensure that breeding is conducted responsibly and ethically.

## Promotion of Spaying and Neutering

2. The spaying and neutering of companion animals (including dogs, cats, and other species designated by regulation) is strongly encouraged and promoted through:
    a. public education and awareness campaigns;
    b. subsidised or free spaying and neutering programmes;
    c. partnerships with veterinary clinics and animal welfare organisations;
    d. incentives for owners of spayed and neutered animals, including reduced registration fees;
    e. requirements for shelters and rescue organisations to spay or neuter animals before adoption;
    f. support programmes for low-income owners; and
    g. any other measures established by regulation or local authorities.

## Registration of Intact Animals

3. While spaying and neutering are not mandatory, owners of intact (not spayed or neutered) companion animals must register their animals as intact with the competent authorities.

4. Registration of intact animals must include:
    a. identification of the owner and contact information;
    b. identification of the animal, including species, breed, sex, age, and distinguishing features;
    c. microchip number or other permanent identification;
    d. reason for keeping the animal intact (breeding programme, show, medical contraindication, or personal choice);
    e. confirmation that the owner understands responsibilities related to intact animals;
    f. any other information required by regulation; and
    g. periodic renewal as required by regulation.

5. Registration of intact animals is subject to a registration fee, which may be set higher than fees for spayed or neutered animals to:
    a. reflect the additional regulatory oversight required;
    b. fund animal welfare and population control programmes;
    c. incentivise spaying and neutering; and
    d. support enforcement and education efforts.

6. Owners of intact animals have additional responsibilities, including:
    a. preventing unplanned breeding and escapes;
    b. securing animals during breeding cycles to prevent uncontrolled mating;
    c. ensuring any breeding is conducted responsibly and ethically;
    d. complying with breeding regulations and restrictions;
    e. being accountable for offspring and ensuring their welfare; and
    f. submitting to any inspections or verifications required by regulation.

## Exemptions from Spaying and Neutering Requirements

7. While spaying and neutering are voluntary, certain categories may be subject to exemptions or specific requirements, including:
    a. animals in registered breeding programmes conducted by responsible breeders;
    b. animals used for showing, competition, or working purposes where intact status is necessary;
    c. animals for which spaying or neutering is medically contraindicated;
    d. animals participating in approved conservation or breeding programmes;
    e. service animals or working animals where reproductive status is relevant to their function; or
    f. any other category established by regulation.

8. Exemptions do not relieve owners of the responsibility to:
    a. register intact animals;
    b. prevent unplanned breeding;
    c. ensure responsible management; and
    d. comply with all applicable regulations.
