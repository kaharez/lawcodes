# Article 3 – Exercise and Extent of Servitudes

1. The extent and manner of exercise of a servitude are determined by the title creating it or, in the absence of clear provisions, by the nature and purpose of the servitude and the needs of the dominant estate.

2. The owner of the dominant estate must exercise the servitude in the manner least burdensome to the servient estate, and may not extend the servitude beyond what is necessary for the benefit of the dominant estate.

3. The owner of the servient estate may not perform any act that diminishes or impedes the exercise of the servitude. Any work or alteration on the servient estate must respect the rights of the dominant estate.

4. If the exercise of a servitude becomes more burdensome due to changes in the use or condition of the dominant estate, the owner of the servient estate may demand that the servitude be modified or extinguished, or that compensation be paid.

5. The owner of the servient estate may, at their own expense, change the location or mode of exercise of the servitude if the change does not diminish its utility to the dominant estate and does not render its exercise more burdensome or inconvenient.

6. If the servitude requires works or installations on the servient estate, the owner of the dominant estate may construct and maintain them, at their own expense, unless otherwise agreed.

7. The owner of the dominant estate must maintain the works necessary for the exercise of the servitude in good repair and may not cause unnecessary damage to the servient estate.

8. In case of doubt, servitudes are to be interpreted in favour of the servient estate and against extension beyond what is strictly necessary for the benefit of the dominant estate.
