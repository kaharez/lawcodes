# Article 2 – Establishment of Servitudes

1. Servitudes may be established by:
    a. title, whether by contract, testamentary disposition, or other juridical act;
    b. destination of the owner, when a single owner of two estates establishes a servitude-like arrangement that continues after the estates are separated;
    c. prescription, through continuous and apparent use for the period prescribed by law;
    d. operation of law, where the law imposes servitudes for reasons of public utility or necessity.

2. The establishment of a servitude by title requires a written instrument signed by the owner of the servient estate or their authorised representative.

3. A servitude established by destination of the owner arises when:
    a. a single owner of two contiguous estates establishes an arrangement whereby one estate serves the other;
    b. the estates are subsequently separated by alienation or succession;
    c. the arrangement was continuous, apparent, and necessary for the use of the dominant estate.

4. Continuous servitudes that are apparent may be acquired by prescription through peaceful, public, and unequivocal exercise for a period of ten years.

5. Discontinuous servitudes and continuous servitudes that are not apparent cannot be acquired by prescription.

6. A servitude is continuous if its exercise does not require current action by the holder, such as a right to receive light or water. A servitude is discontinuous if its exercise requires repeated action, such as a right of way.

7. A servitude is apparent if its existence is revealed by external signs or works, such as a path, canal, or window. A servitude is non-apparent if no such signs exist.

8. Legal servitudes imposed by law for public utility or necessity take effect without the need for a title, registration, or prescription, and are governed by the specific provisions of law establishing them.
