# Article 4 – Extinction of Servitudes

1. A servitude is extinguished by:
    a. consolidation, when ownership of the dominant and servient estates becomes united in the same person;
    b. renunciation by the owner of the dominant estate;
    c. expiry of the term, if the servitude was established for a fixed period;
    d. non-use for a continuous period of twenty years;
    e. impossibility of exercise, where the condition of the estates renders exercise permanently impossible;
    f. loss or total destruction of either the dominant or servient estate;
    g. judicial decree, where the servitude has become excessively burdensome or its purpose has ceased.

2. Consolidation extinguishes the servitude automatically. If the estates are subsequently separated, the servitude does not revive unless re-established by title, destination, or prescription.

3. Renunciation of a servitude by the owner of the dominant estate must be express and in writing. Renunciation is irrevocable once communicated to the owner of the servient estate.

4. For purposes of extinction by non-use:
    a. time runs from the last exercise of a discontinuous servitude or from the act preventing exercise of a continuous servitude;
    b. non-use by one co-owner of a divided dominant estate does not prejudice the other co-owners;
    c. time does not run during periods when exercise is legally or physically impossible.

5. Temporary impossibility of exercise does not extinguish the servitude, unless the impossibility continues for the full prescriptive period.

6. A servitude may be extinguished by judicial decree upon petition of the owner of the servient estate, if:
    a. the purpose for which the servitude was established has permanently ceased;
    b. the servitude has become excessively burdensome in relation to the benefit it provides;
    c. the dominant estate can be adequately served by other means without disproportionate expense.

7. Upon extinction of a servitude, the owner of the servient estate is relieved of all obligations arising from it, and any works or installations made for its exercise may be removed, unless the parties agree otherwise or the court orders their retention with compensation.

8. Legal servitudes imposed by operation of law are extinguished only when the conditions that justified their imposition cease to exist or when they are revoked by law or decree.
