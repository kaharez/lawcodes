# Article 1 – Nature of Servitudes

1. A servitude is a charge imposed upon immovable property (the servient estate) for the benefit of immovable property belonging to another owner (the dominant estate).

2. A servitude confers upon the owner of the dominant estate a limited right to use the servient estate, or to prevent the owner of the servient estate from exercising certain rights of ownership.

3. Servitudes must provide a real benefit to the dominant estate and may not be established solely for the personal convenience of its owner.

4. The owner of the servient estate retains full ownership of the property, subject to the burden of the servitude, and may use the property in any manner that does not interfere with the exercise of the servitude.

5. Servitudes are indivisible. If either the dominant or servient estate is divided among multiple owners, the servitude remains in effect for the benefit or burden of each portion.

6. Servitudes may not be alienated or encumbered separately from the dominant estate, and pass automatically with ownership of the dominant estate.

7. The owner of the dominant estate is responsible for the expenses necessary to preserve and maintain the servitude, unless otherwise agreed or provided by law.
