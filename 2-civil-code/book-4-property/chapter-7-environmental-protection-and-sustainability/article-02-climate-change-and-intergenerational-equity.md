# Article 2 – Climate Change and Intergenerational Equity

1. Climate change poses an existential threat to present and future generations. All persons, enterprises, and public authorities have a duty to act urgently to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts.

2. Property use and economic activities must be consistent with:
    (a) the goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as required by climate science and international commitments;
    (b) achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier, as established by law;
    (c) building resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change impacts;
    (d) protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from climate harms.

3. Owners of land, buildings, and industrial facilities must:
    (a) measure and report greenhouse gas emissions from their activities;
    (b) implement measures to reduce emissions, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and low-carbon technologies;
    (c) transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy sources;
    (d) enhance carbon sequestration through reforestation, soil management, and protection of natural carbon sinks;
    (e) adapt infrastructure and land use to climate risks, including extreme heat, drought, flooding, and sea level rise.

4. High-emitting activities and facilities are subject to:
    (a) carbon pricing, through taxes or emissions trading schemes, making polluters pay for climate harms;
    (b) emissions caps and reduction targets, declining over time toward net-zero;
    (c) mandatory transition plans demonstrating how emissions will be eliminated;
    (d) potential phaseout or prohibition if incompatible with climate goals.

5. New construction and major renovations must meet stringent energy efficiency and emissions standards, including:
    (a) near-zero energy buildings, with minimal energy demand met largely by renewable sources;
    (b) prohibition of fossil fuel heating systems in new buildings;
    (c) requirements for solar panels, heat pumps, and energy storage where technically and economically feasible;
    (d) green building certifications and performance standards.

6. Existing buildings must be retrofitted to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions, with:
    (a) mandatory minimum performance standards phased in over time;
    (b) subsidies, loans, and technical assistance to support retrofits, especially for low-income owners;
    (c) priority for retrofitting public and social housing, demonstrating leadership;
    (d) measures to ensure that energy efficiency improvements do not lead to rent increases or displacement of tenants.

7. Land use planning and development must promote climate mitigation and adaptation by:
    (a) concentrating development in compact, transit-accessible, mixed-use areas to reduce car dependence and emissions;
    (b) preserving and expanding green spaces, urban forests, and natural areas for carbon sequestration, cooling, and stormwater management;
    (c) restricting development in areas vulnerable to climate impacts, including floodplains, coastal zones, and wildfire-prone areas;
    (d) ensuring infrastructure resilience to extreme weather and long-term climate changes.

8. Protection and restoration of natural carbon sinks, including forests, wetlands, peatlands, and coastal ecosystems, are priorities. These ecosystems must be:
    (a) protected from destruction, degradation, or conversion to other uses;
    (b) restored where degraded or destroyed, through reforestation, wetland restoration, and ecological rehabilitation;
    (c) managed sustainably to maintain their carbon storage and sequestration capacity;
    (d) recognized as providing climate regulation services of public benefit.

9. Agricultural and forestry practices must transition to climate-friendly methods, including:
    (a) agroecology, regenerative agriculture, and organic farming, enhancing soil carbon and reducing emissions;
    (b) reduction of livestock emissions through improved management, dietary changes, and shift toward plant-based production;
    (c) sustainable forestry maintaining forest cover and carbon stocks;
    (d) protection of agricultural land from urban sprawl, preserving food security and carbon sinks.

10. Intergenerational equity requires that present generations act as trustees of the environment for future generations, ensuring that:
    (a) natural resources and ecosystems are preserved and enhanced, not depleted or degraded;
    (b) climate change is limited to avoid catastrophic harms to future generations;
    (c) environmental debts, including pollution, contamination, and ecosystem destruction, are not passed on to future generations;
    (d) future generations have the opportunity to enjoy a healthy environment and natural heritage equivalent to that inherited by the present generation.

11. The rights of future generations are represented in legal and policy processes by:
    (a) independent advocates or ombudspersons for future generations, with standing to challenge decisions harmful to long-term environmental interests;
    (b) mandatory consideration of long-term and intergenerational impacts in environmental assessments and policy decisions;
    (c) public trust doctrines recognizing the state's duty to protect natural resources for future generations;
    (d) constitutional or statutory protections for environmental rights and climate stability.

12. Environmental and climate policies must be based on the best available science, with regular updates reflecting advancing knowledge. Public authorities have a duty to:
    (a) monitor environmental conditions, emissions, and climate impacts;
    (b) set and enforce science-based targets and standards;
    (c) invest in climate science, environmental research, and green innovation;
    (d) educate the public about environmental and climate challenges and solutions.

13. Climate justice requires that:
    (a) the costs and burdens of climate action are distributed fairly, with polluters and the wealthy bearing greater responsibility;
    (b) vulnerable and marginalized communities, who have contributed least to climate change but suffer most from its impacts, are protected and supported;
    (c) workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel industries receive support for just transition to clean energy economies;
    (d) international solidarity ensures that poorer nations, which have contributed least to historical emissions, receive financial and technical assistance for mitigation and adaptation.

14. Failure by public authorities to take adequate action on climate change may be challenged through litigation, based on constitutional rights, statutory duties, and the principles of intergenerational equity and public trust. Courts have a duty to enforce climate obligations and protect fundamental rights threatened by climate inaction.
