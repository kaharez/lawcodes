# Article 1 – Environmental Duties and Sustainable Use

1. All property rights are subject to environmental duties and the obligation to use property in a manner that:
    (a) protects the natural environment, biodiversity, and ecological integrity;
    (b) prevents pollution, degradation, and depletion of natural resources;
    (c) promotes sustainability and meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs;
    (d) respects the rights of others to a healthy environment and natural amenities;
    (e) contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation.

2. Owners of land and natural resources are stewards, not absolute masters, of these resources. They have a duty to:
    (a) manage land, water, forests, and other natural resources sustainably, maintaining their productivity and ecological functions;
    (b) prevent soil erosion, contamination, and degradation;
    (c) protect water quality and aquatic ecosystems;
    (d) preserve biodiversity, habitats, and ecosystems;
    (e) minimize greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sequestration;
    (f) adapt land use to climate change impacts, including sea level rise, extreme weather, and changing precipitation patterns.

3. The following uses of property are prohibited or restricted:
    (a) activities causing significant pollution of air, water, or soil;
    (b) destruction of protected habitats, wetlands, forests, or other ecologically sensitive areas;
    (c) extraction or exploitation of natural resources at unsustainable rates;
    (d) introduction of invasive species or genetically modified organisms posing environmental risks;
    (e) development in areas vulnerable to natural hazards, including floodplains, steep slopes, and coastal zones subject to erosion;
    (f) any use that causes irreversible environmental harm or violates environmental protection laws.

4. Owners undertaking activities with potential environmental impacts must:
    (a) conduct environmental impact assessments before commencing projects likely to have significant effects on the environment;
    (b) obtain environmental permits and comply with conditions designed to prevent or mitigate harm;
    (c) implement best available techniques and practices to minimize environmental impacts;
    (d) monitor environmental effects and report to regulatory authorities;
    (e) provide financial security for environmental remediation and restoration;
    (f) consult with affected communities and respect their rights to participate in environmental decision-making.

5. Environmental impact assessment is required for:
    (a) major construction projects, including infrastructure, industrial facilities, and large-scale residential or commercial development;
    (b) projects involving extraction of natural resources, including mining, quarrying, logging, and water abstraction;
    (c) agricultural or forestry activities involving significant land conversion or intensification;
    (d) projects in environmentally sensitive areas, including protected areas, wetlands, coastal zones, and watersheds;
    (e) any project likely to cause significant pollution, habitat destruction, or other environmental harm.

6. Environmental impact assessment must:
    (a) identify and evaluate potential environmental effects, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts;
    (b) consider alternatives, including the option of not proceeding with the project;
    (c) propose measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for environmental harm;
    (d) be conducted by qualified experts independent of the project proponent;
    (e) be subject to public review and comment, with results published and accessible;
    (f) inform the decision whether to authorize the project and under what conditions.

7. The precautionary principle applies: where there is a threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

8. Owners who cause environmental damage are strictly liable for:
    (a) costs of remediation, restoration, and cleanup;
    (b) compensation to persons harmed by pollution or environmental degradation;
    (c) damages to public natural resources and ecosystem services;
    (d) administrative fines and penalties;
    (e) criminal sanctions for serious or intentional violations.

9. Environmental liability is joint and several among multiple responsible parties and extends to:
    (a) current owners and occupiers of contaminated land;
    (b) persons who caused or contributed to contamination, even if they no longer own the property;
    (c) corporations and their officers, directors, and shareholders in cases of environmental crimes or gross negligence.

10. Contaminated land and water must be remediated to safe levels, with costs borne by responsible parties. Where responsible parties cannot be identified or are insolvent, the state may remediate at public expense and recover costs through levies on polluting industries.

11. Protected areas, including national parks, nature reserves, wetlands, and cultural landscapes, are withdrawn from private ownership or subject to strict use restrictions ensuring conservation. Existing property rights in protected areas may be expropriated with fair compensation or subject to conservation easements and management agreements.

12. Natural resources of national importance, including water, minerals, forests, and fisheries, are public patrimony. Private rights to use or exploit these resources are granted by concession or permit, subject to sustainable management requirements, public interest considerations, and payment of royalties or resource rents.

13. Indigenous and traditional communities have rights to lands, waters, and natural resources they have traditionally used, managed, or occupied. These rights include:
    (a) recognition and protection of customary land tenure and resource management systems;
    (b) free, prior, and informed consent for projects affecting their territories;
    (c) sharing of benefits from resource exploitation on their lands;
    (d) participation in environmental governance and decision-making.

14. Environmental disputes may be resolved through specialized environmental courts or tribunals, with access to justice for affected communities, environmental organizations, and public authorities. nationals and organizations have standing to bring environmental public interest litigation to enforce environmental laws and protect public natural resources.
