# Article 3 – Rights of Use and Habitation

1. The right of use is a limited real right that entitles the holder to use property belonging to another and to receive such fruits and revenues as are necessary for the needs of the holder and their family.

2. The right of use is more restricted than usufruct and is limited to the personal needs of the holder. The holder may not alienate, lease, or encumber the right, except with the consent of the owner.

3. The holder of a right of use is subject to the same obligations as a usufructuary with respect to preservation, maintenance, and return of the property.

4. Habitation is a right of use limited to dwelling in a house or part of a house belonging to another, to the extent necessary for the accommodation of the holder and their family.

5. The holder of a right of habitation may not lease the dwelling to others without the consent of the owner, but may permit members of their family to reside with them.

6. Rights of use and habitation are established and extinguished in the same manner as usufruct, and are strictly personal rights that cannot be transferred or inherited.

7. The extent of the right of use or habitation is determined by the instrument creating it or, in the absence of specification, by the personal and family needs of the holder at the time of establishment.

8. The right of use or habitation is extinguished by the death of the holder or by the cessation of the family needs that justified its establishment, in addition to the causes applicable to usufruct.
