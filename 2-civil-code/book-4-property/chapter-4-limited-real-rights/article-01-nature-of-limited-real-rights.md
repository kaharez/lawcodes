# Article 1 – Nature of Limited Real Rights

1. A limited real right is a right over property belonging to another that confers upon the holder specific powers of use, enjoyment, or security, without transferring ownership.

2. Limited real rights include:
    a. usufruct;
    b. rights of use and habitation;
    c. servitudes;
    d. pledge and other security interests;
    e. such other real rights as are recognised by law.

3. Limited real rights may be established by:
    a. contract or juridical act;
    b. testamentary disposition;
    c. operation of law;
    d. prescription, where permitted by law.

4. A limited real right must be compatible with the nature of the property and may not render ownership illusory or deprive the owner of all substantial rights.

5. The establishment, transfer, and extinction of limited real rights over immovable property must be evidenced by written instrument.

6. Limited real rights follow the property into the hands of any subsequent owner, subject to the requirements of publicity or registration where applicable.

7. A limited real right is extinguished by:
    a. expiry of the term or occurrence of a condition;
    b. consolidation with ownership in the same person;
    c. renunciation by the holder;
    d. loss or destruction of the property;
    e. other causes provided by law.
