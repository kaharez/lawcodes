# Article 2 – Usufruct

1. Usufruct is the right to use and enjoy property belonging to another and to receive the fruits and revenues it produces, while preserving the substance of the property.

2. The usufructuary has the right to:
    a. possess and use the property;
    b. receive the natural and civil fruits produced by the property;
    c. administer the property and lease it to others, unless otherwise restricted;
    d. make improvements necessary for preservation and maintenance.

3. The usufructuary is obliged to:
    a. preserve the property in good condition and use it in accordance with its nature and destination;
    b. bear the ordinary expenses of maintenance and administration;
    c. pay taxes and charges that customarily burden the enjoyment of the property;
    d. provide security for the faithful performance of their obligations, if required by the owner or by law.

4. The bare owner retains ownership of the property and is responsible for extraordinary repairs and improvements that preserve or increase the capital value of the property, unless otherwise agreed.

5. At the termination of the usufruct, the usufructuary must return the property in the condition in which it was received, subject to ordinary wear and tear. Improvements made by the usufructuary remain for the benefit of the owner without compensation, unless otherwise agreed.

6. Usufruct may be established over both movable and immovable property, and over corporeal and incorporeal rights capable of producing fruits or revenues.

7. Usufruct is extinguished by:
    a. death of the usufructuary, if a natural person;
    b. expiry of the term, if established for a fixed period;
    c. dissolution of the juridical person, if the usufructuary is a legal entity;
    d. consolidation, if the usufructuary acquires ownership;
    e. total loss or destruction of the property;
    f. renunciation by the usufructuary;
    g. non-use for the prescriptive period established by law.

8. Usufruct in favour of a juridical person may not exceed thirty years from its establishment, unless a shorter term is specified.
