# Article 2 – Occupation

1. Occupation is the acquisition of ownership of corporeal movable things that have no owner, by taking possession of them with the intention to acquire ownership.

2. Things capable of occupation include:
    (a) wild animals in their natural state;
    (b) abandoned movable property;
    (c) treasure found in one's own property or, with permission, in the property of another;
    (d) other things declared capable of occupation by law.

3. Things forming part of the sovereign or public domain of the state may not be acquired by occupation.

4. A wild animal captured in accordance with law becomes the property of the person who captures it. If the animal escapes and regains its natural liberty, ownership is lost.

5. Property is considered abandoned when the owner voluntarily relinquishes possession and ownership with the manifest intention not to retain any right over it. Abandoned property may be acquired by occupation.

6. Treasure consists of valuable objects hidden or buried, the ownership of which cannot be established. Treasure found in one's own property belongs entirely to the finder. Treasure found in another's property belongs half to the finder and half to the owner of the property, unless otherwise agreed.

7. Objects lost or mislaid are not subject to occupation. The finder of lost property must deliver it to the competent authority or make reasonable efforts to return it to the owner. If the owner is not found within the period prescribed by law, ownership may vest in the finder in accordance with procedures established by law or decree.
