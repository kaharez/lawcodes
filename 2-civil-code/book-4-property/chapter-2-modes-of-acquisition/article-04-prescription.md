# Article 4 – Prescription

1. Prescription is the acquisition of ownership through continuous, uninterrupted, peaceful, public, and unequivocal possession of property for the period established by law.

2. Possession sufficient to found prescription must be:
    (a) continuous, without significant interruption;
    (b) peaceful, not obtained or maintained by force;
    (c) public, open and not clandestine;
    (d) unequivocal, manifesting an intention to possess as owner;
    (e) in good faith, where the possessor has a reasonable belief in their right to possess.

3. The period of prescription for immovable property is:
    (a) ten years, where possession is in good faith and based on a valid title;
    (b) twenty years, where possession is in good faith but without valid title, or in bad faith.

4. The period of prescription for movable property is:
    (a) three years, where possession is in good faith;
    (b) ten years, where possession is in bad faith.

5. Possession is presumed to be in good faith unless the contrary is proven. Good faith need only exist at the commencement of possession.

6. Time runs from the moment possession is acquired. Time may be interrupted by:
    (a) judicial claim by the owner;
    (b) acknowledgment by the possessor of the owner's right;
    (c) loss of possession for more than one year.

7. A possessor may join their period of possession with that of their predecessor, provided possession has been continuous and uninterrupted.

8. Prescription does not run against:
    (a) property of the sovereign or public domain of the state;
    (b) minors or persons lacking legal capacity, until the disability ceases or a guardian is appointed;
    (c) property subject to litigation, during the pendency of proceedings.

9. Upon completion of the prescriptive period, the possessor acquires ownership by operation of law and may seek judicial declaration of ownership.
