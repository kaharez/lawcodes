# Article 1 – General Principles

1. Ownership of property may be acquired by:
    (a) occupation of things that belong to no one;
    (b) accession, whether natural or artificial;
    (c) prescription, through continuous possession;
    (d) succession, whether testamentary or intestate;
    (e) contract or other juridical acts;
    (f) operation of law.

2. The acquisition of ownership must be compatible with the laws of the state, public order, and the rights of others.

3. No person may transfer more rights than they possess. A transfer by a non-owner does not confer ownership upon the acquirer, except where acquisition is protected by good faith and other conditions established by law.

4. Acquisition of ownership of immovable property is governed by the law of the place where the immovable is situated.

5. Acquisition of ownership of movable property is governed by the law of the place where the movable is situated at the time of acquisition, or by the law of the state where applicable.

6. Ownership acquired in accordance with the law is protected and may not be divested except by operation of law, voluntary transfer, expropriation for public purpose with just compensation, or other means established by law.
