# Article 1 – Breach and Remedies

1. Non-performance of an obligation occurs when the debtor fails to perform, performs defectively, or performs late, without lawful excuse.

2. Upon non-performance, the creditor may, at their option and subject to the nature of the obligation:
    a. demand specific performance;
    b. demand performance by a third party at the debtor's expense, where appropriate;
    c. terminate the contract, if the breach is fundamental;
    d. claim damages for any loss suffered.

3. A breach is fundamental if it substantially deprives the creditor of what they were entitled to expect under the contract, unless the debtor did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen such result.

4. Before exercising remedies, the creditor must give the debtor notice and a reasonable period to remedy the breach, unless immediate action is justified by the circumstances or the debtor has repudiated the obligation.

5. Specific performance may be ordered by the court unless:
    a. performance is impossible or unlawful;
    b. performance would require disproportionate effort or expense;
    c. the creditor may reasonably obtain performance from another source;
    d. the obligation is strictly personal.

6. Where specific performance is not available or elected, the creditor is entitled to damages sufficient to place them in the position they would have been in had the obligation been performed.

7. Damages include both actual loss suffered and gain of which the creditor was deprived, to the extent that they were foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the contract or arise naturally from the breach.

8. The creditor has a duty to mitigate loss by taking reasonable steps to reduce the damage. Damages for avoidable loss are not recoverable.

9. Remedies for non-performance are subject to time limits. The creditor must act within a reasonable time and, in any event, before expiry of applicable prescription periods.

10. Where both parties have failed to perform, the court may apportion liability and adjust remedies according to the fault and circumstances of each party.
