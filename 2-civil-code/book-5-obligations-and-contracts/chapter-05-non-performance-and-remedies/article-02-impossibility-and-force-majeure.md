# Article 2 – Impossibility and Force Majeure

1. A debtor is excused from non-performance where performance has become impossible due to circumstances beyond their control and for which they are not responsible.

2. Impossibility may be physical, legal, or economic, and must be objective and absolute, not merely difficult or burdensome.

3. Where impossibility is partial, the debtor remains bound to perform what remains possible, and the creditor may reduce their counter-performance proportionately or terminate the contract if the partial performance is of no interest.

4. Where impossibility is temporary, the obligation is suspended during the period of impossibility. If the delay defeats the purpose of the contract, the obligation is extinguished.

5. Force majeure is an unforeseeable and irresistible event that prevents performance and excuses the debtor from liability. Events of force majeure include natural disasters, war, governmental acts, and other exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the parties.

6. The debtor claiming force majeure has the burden of proving:
    (a) the occurrence of an event beyond their control;
    (b) that the event was unforeseeable at the time of the conclusion of the contract;
    (c) that the event made performance impossible and could not be avoided or overcome by reasonable efforts.

7. Force majeure does not excuse non-performance if:
    (a) the debtor was already in breach at the time of the event;
    (b) the debtor expressly assumed the risk of the event;
    (c) the event was caused or contributed to by the fault of the debtor.

8. Upon impossibility or force majeure, the obligation is extinguished without liability, and any counter-performance is correspondingly extinguished. The parties must restore any performances already rendered, subject to equitable adjustment.

9. If one party benefits from the impossibility, they must compensate the other party to the extent of the benefit received.

10. Contracts may allocate risks differently and define force majeure events. Such provisions are binding unless manifestly unreasonable or contrary to public policy.
