# Article 1 – Nature of Obligations

1. An obligation is a legal relationship whereby one person, the debtor, is bound to perform a specific act or forbearance for the benefit of another person, the creditor.

2. The object of an obligation may consist of:
    a. giving or delivering something;
    b. doing or performing an act or service;
    c. refraining from doing something.

3. Every obligation must have:
    a. parties capable of creating legal relations;
    b. an object that is possible, lawful, and sufficiently determined or determinable;
    c. a cause or juridical ground that justifies the obligation.

4. An obligation that lacks any essential element is null and produces no legal effects.

5. Obligations may arise from:
    a. contracts and other juridical acts;
    b. delicts and quasi-delicts;
    c. quasi-contracts and other facts to which the law attaches obligations;
    d. operation of law.

6. Unless otherwise provided by law or agreement, obligations are presumed to be of result, requiring the debtor to achieve a specific outcome, rather than obligations of means, requiring only reasonable efforts.

7. Obligations are governed by the law chosen by the parties or, in the absence of choice, by the law of the place of performance or the law with the closest connection to the obligation.
