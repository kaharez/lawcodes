# Article 2 – Modalities of Obligations

1. Obligations may be pure and simple, or subject to terms, conditions, or other modalities affecting their existence, performance, or enforceability.

2. A conditional obligation is one whose existence or extinction depends upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future and uncertain event.

3. A suspensive condition delays the existence of the obligation until the condition is fulfilled. A resolutory condition terminates an existing obligation upon fulfilment of the condition.

4. During the pendency of a suspensive condition, the creditor may take conservatory measures to preserve their rights, but may not demand performance.

5. A condition is deemed fulfilled when:
    (a) the uncertain event occurs;
    (b) fulfilment is prevented by the party who would benefit from non-fulfilment.

6. A term is a future event that is certain to occur, which delays or terminates the performance of an obligation. An obligation subject to a suspensive term is enforceable but not yet due. An obligation subject to a resolutory term terminates upon arrival of the term.

7. Alternative obligations give the debtor or, where specified, the creditor, the right to choose between two or more modes of performance. The choice, once made and communicated, is irrevocable.

8. Joint obligations bind multiple debtors or entitle multiple creditors, each for their proportionate share. Solidary obligations bind multiple debtors, each for the entire obligation, or entitle multiple creditors, each to demand the entire obligation.

9. Divisible obligations may be performed in parts. Indivisible obligations must be performed in their entirety and may not be divided among multiple debtors or creditors.

10. The modalities of obligations are strictly interpreted and may not be extended beyond their express terms or the clear intention of the parties.
