# Article 1 – Sale

1. Sale is a contract whereby the seller transfers ownership of a thing or right to the buyer in exchange for a price in money.

2. Sale is perfected by agreement on the thing and the price, even if the thing has not been delivered or the price paid.

3. The seller is obliged to:
    (a) deliver the thing sold in the condition agreed, with all accessories and documents;
    (b) transfer ownership free from encumbrances not disclosed or accepted by the buyer;
    (c) warrant against eviction and hidden defects.

4. The buyer is obliged to:
    (a) pay the price at the time and place agreed;
    (b) take delivery of the thing sold;
    (c) bear the expenses of delivery unless otherwise agreed.

5. Risk of loss or damage passes to the buyer upon delivery, unless otherwise agreed. Where the seller delays delivery in breach, risk passes only upon actual delivery.

6. The seller warrants that the buyer will not be evicted by a third party claiming superior title. If eviction occurs, the buyer may rescind the sale and recover the price, or claim damages.

7. The seller warrants against hidden defects that render the thing unfit for its intended use or materially diminish its value. The buyer may, at their option, rescind the sale or claim a reduction in price.

8. The warranty against hidden defects does not apply where:
    (a) the buyer knew or ought to have known of the defect;
    (b) the defect was apparent upon reasonable inspection;
    (c) the seller expressly excluded warranty with the buyer's informed consent.

9. Claims for breach of warranty must be brought within a reasonable time after discovery of the eviction or defect, and in any event within two years of delivery.

10. Where the sale of immovable property is not completed by transfer of title, the buyer acquires a personal right to demand performance but does not become owner until title is transferred in accordance with law.
