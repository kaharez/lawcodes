# Article 2 – Lease, Loan, and Mandate

1. Lease is a contract whereby the lessor grants the lessee the use and enjoyment of a thing for a fixed or indeterminate period in exchange for rent.

2. The lessor must deliver the thing in a condition suitable for the agreed use and maintain it in that condition during the lease. The lessee must use the thing as a prudent person, pay the rent, and return the thing at the end of the lease.

3. The lessee may not transfer the lease or sublet the thing without the consent of the lessor, unless otherwise agreed or authorized by law.

4. Loan for use (commodatum) is a gratuitous contract whereby the lender delivers a thing to the borrower for use, with the obligation to return the same thing. The borrower may use the thing only for the purpose agreed and must return it upon demand or expiry of the agreed term.

5. Loan for consumption (mutuum) is a contract whereby the lender delivers fungible goods to the borrower, who acquires ownership and is obliged to return an equivalent quantity and quality. Unless otherwise agreed, no interest is due on gratuitous loans.

6. Interest on loans is subject to legal limits to protect borrowers from exploitation:
    (a) the maximum annual interest rate for consumer loans is eighteen percent (18%), calculated on the outstanding principal balance;
    (b) the maximum annual interest rate for commercial loans is twenty-four percent (24%);
    (c) interest on interest (compound interest) is prohibited unless explicitly agreed in writing and does not exceed the applicable maximum rate when calculated on the original principal;
    (d) fees, charges, and other costs imposed by the lender are included in calculating the effective interest rate and may not be used to circumvent interest rate limits.

7. Usurious interest exceeding these limits is void. Where a loan provides for usurious interest:
    (a) the entire interest obligation is void and no interest is due;
    (b) the borrower remains obliged to repay only the principal sum borrowed;
    (c) any interest already paid may be recovered or credited against the principal;
    (d) the lender may face penalties and sanctions for usury, including fines and suspension of lending privileges.

8. Loans to consumers in financial distress, including payday loans, title loans, and similar high-cost short-term credit, are subject to enhanced regulation, including lower interest rate caps, mandatory affordability assessments, and restrictions on rollovers and refinancing.

9. Mandate is a contract whereby the mandatary undertakes to perform juridical acts on behalf of and in the interest of the mandator.

10. The mandatary must execute the mandate with the care of a prudent administrator, within the limits of the authority granted, and must account for all actions and property received.

11. The mandator must reimburse expenses incurred by the mandatary in executing the mandate and must indemnify the mandatary against liabilities reasonably incurred.

12. Mandate may be gratuitous or for remuneration. Where remuneration is not agreed, it is presumed to be gratuitous unless the mandatary exercises the activity professionally.

13. Mandate terminates by:
    (a) completion of the mandated act;
    (b) expiry of the term or occurrence of a condition;
    (c) revocation by the mandator or renunciation by the mandatary;
    (d) death, incapacity, or insolvency of either party, unless otherwise agreed.
