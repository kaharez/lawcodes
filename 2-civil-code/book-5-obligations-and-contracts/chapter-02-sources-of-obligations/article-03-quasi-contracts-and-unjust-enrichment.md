# Article 3 – Quasi-Contracts and Unjust Enrichment

1. Quasi-contracts are lawful and voluntary acts from which obligations arise without agreement, by operation of law, including management of another's affairs and unjust enrichment.

2. Management of another's affairs occurs when a person, without authority and without being obliged, voluntarily manages the affair of another who is absent or unable to act.

3. The manager must act in the best interest of the person whose affair is managed, with the care of a prudent administrator, and must account for all actions taken and property received.

4. The person whose affair is managed must reimburse the manager for necessary and useful expenses incurred in good faith and must indemnify the manager against obligations reasonably undertaken on their behalf.

5. If the manager acts in bad faith or with gross negligence, they are liable for all damage caused and forfeit any right to reimbursement or indemnification.

6. Unjust enrichment occurs when a person is enriched at the expense of another without juridical cause, creating an obligation to restore the benefit to the extent of the enrichment.

7. The elements of unjust enrichment are:
    a. enrichment of one party;
    b. impoverishment of another party;
    c. a causal connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment;
    d. absence of juridical cause or legal justification for the enrichment.

8. The obligation arising from unjust enrichment requires restoration of the benefit received or, if restoration in kind is impossible, payment of its value.

9. The extent of restitution is limited to the lesser of the enrichment of the recipient or the impoverishment of the claimant, and is reduced to the extent that the enrichment no longer subsists at the time of the claim.

10. A claim for unjust enrichment may not be brought where:
    a. the enrichment is justified by contract, delict, or other source of obligation;
    b. the impoverished party voluntarily conferred the benefit without expectation of recompense;
    c. the claim is barred by prescription or another legal defence.

11. The right to claim restitution for unjust enrichment prescribes after three years from the date the impoverished party became aware or should have become aware of the enrichment and the identity of the enriched party, and in any event after ten years from the enrichment.
