# Article 2 – Delicts and Quasi-Delicts

1. A delict is a wrongful act committed with intent or negligence that causes damage to another, giving rise to an obligation to make reparation.

2. A quasi-delict is a wrongful act committed without intent but through fault or negligence, causing damage to another and creating an obligation to compensate.

3. Every person is liable for damage caused by their intentional or negligent acts or omissions, except where the act is justified by law, necessity, self-defence, or the exercise of a right.

4. The elements of delictual liability are:
    (a) a wrongful act or omission contrary to law or to the duty of care owed to others;
    (b) fault, consisting of intent, negligence, or recklessness;
    (c) damage or injury suffered by the victim;
    (d) a causal connection between the wrongful act and the damage.

5. Liability for delict or quasi-delict is personal. Each person is responsible for their own acts and may not be held liable for the acts of others, except as provided by law in cases of vicarious liability.

6. Parents, guardians, tutors, and employers may be held vicariously liable for damage caused by those under their authority or in their employ, where they failed to exercise adequate supervision or control.

7. A person who causes damage while in a state of mental incapacity is nonetheless liable, unless the incapacity was caused by external force or the fault of another.

8. Damage includes both material loss and moral injury. Compensation must restore the victim, so far as possible, to the position they would have been in had the delict not occurred.

9. The victim of a delict or quasi-delict has the burden of proving the wrongful act, fault, damage, and causal connection.

10. The right to claim damages arising from delict or quasi-delict is extinguished by prescription after three years from the date the victim became aware or should have become aware of the damage and the identity of the person responsible, and in any event after ten years from the commission of the act.
