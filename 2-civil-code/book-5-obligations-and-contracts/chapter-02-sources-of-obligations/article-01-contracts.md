# Article 1 – Contracts

1. A contract is an agreement between two or more persons whereby they create, modify, or extinguish obligations.

2. Contracts freely entered into have the force of law between the parties and must be performed in good faith.

3. No one may be bound by a contract without their consent, freely and validly given, except as provided by law.

4. Contracts have effect not only between the parties but also, where applicable, in favour of third parties in accordance with the provisions governing third-party beneficiaries and stipulations for another.

5. Parties are free to enter into any contract they choose and to determine its contents, provided that:
    a. the contract does not violate mandatory provisions of law;
    b. the contract does not contravene public order or morals;
    c. the object and cause of the contract are lawful.

6. In addition to the obligations expressly undertaken, contracts impose obligations of good faith, including duties to cooperate, inform, and act loyally toward the other party.

7. Silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance of a contractual offer, except where the law, usage, or previous dealings between the parties give silence the value of consent.

8. Contracts must be interpreted according to the common intention of the parties, ascertained from the terms of the contract, the circumstances surrounding its formation, and the conduct of the parties.

9. Where the intention of the parties cannot be ascertained, contracts are interpreted in accordance with principles of good faith, usages, and the nature of the contract.

10. Contracts bind not only as to what is expressly stated but also as to all consequences that follow from their nature, usage, equity, or law.
