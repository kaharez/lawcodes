# Article 2 – Rent Control and Affordability

1. Rents for residential leases are subject to regulation to ensure affordability and prevent exploitation. Initial rents and rent increases are limited by law.

2. Initial rent must be reasonable and proportionate to:
    a. the size, condition, and location of the dwelling;
    b. prevailing market rents for comparable dwellings in the area;
    c. the tenant's ability to pay, taking into account income and household size.

3. Rent may be increased only:
    a. once per year, and not during the first year of the lease;
    b. in accordance with an inflation index or percentage cap established by law, whichever is lower;
    c. after giving the tenant at least three months' advance notice.

4. The maximum annual rent increase is capped at the consumer price index or three percent, whichever is lower, unless the landlord has made substantial improvements to the property with the tenant's consent.

5. Rent increases exceeding the cap require judicial approval and proof that:
    a. the landlord has made substantial improvements that increase the value or habitability of the dwelling;
    b. the increase is justified by extraordinary circumstances;
    c. the increase does not impose excessive hardship on the tenant.

6. Tenants may challenge rent increases as excessive by petition to the rent control board or court. If the increase is found excessive, it is reduced to the lawful amount and the landlord must refund any overpayment with interest.

7. Rent control boards have authority to:
    a. establish rent guidelines for different classes of dwellings and neighborhoods;
    b. review and adjust rents upon petition of tenants or landlords;
    c. investigate complaints of excessive rent or rent gouging;
    d. impose penalties for violations of rent control laws.

8. In areas with housing shortages or affordability crises, stricter rent controls may be imposed, including rent freezes or rollbacks, as necessary to protect tenants and ensure housing security.

9. Landlords may not demand advance payment of more than one month's rent as deposit, and deposits must be held in escrow and returned with interest upon termination of the lease, less any lawful deductions for damage.

10. Landlords may not demand payment of rent in cash or require tenants to pay for utilities, services, or amenities not included in the lease. All charges must be transparent and itemized.

11. Tenants who experience financial hardship due to unemployment, illness, or other circumstances beyond their control have the right to request temporary rent reduction or deferred payment, subject to review and approval by the rent control board or social welfare authority.
