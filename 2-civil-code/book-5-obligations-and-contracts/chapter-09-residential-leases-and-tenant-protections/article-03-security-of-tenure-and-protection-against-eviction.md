# Article 3 – Security of Tenure and Protection Against Eviction

1. Tenants have a right to security of tenure and may not be evicted except for just cause established by law and after due process.

2. Just causes for eviction include only:
    (a) non-payment of rent for three consecutive months, after notice and opportunity to cure;
    (b) serious and repeated breach of tenant obligations, causing substantial harm to the property or to other tenants;
    (c) use of the dwelling for illegal purposes;
    (d) the landlord's genuine need to occupy the dwelling as their primary residence or that of a close family member;
    (e) substantial renovation or demolition necessary for safety, requiring vacation of the premises;
    (f) expropriation or compulsory purchase for public purposes.

3. Eviction for non-payment of rent may not proceed if:
    (a) the tenant pays the arrears plus reasonable costs before the eviction order;
    (b) the tenant demonstrates financial hardship and enters into a payment plan approved by the court;
    (c) the landlord has failed to maintain the property in habitable condition;
    (d) the rent demanded exceeds the lawful amount.

4. Eviction for breach of tenant obligations requires:
    (a) written notice specifying the breach and a reasonable period to cure;
    (b) judicial determination that the breach is serious and not trivial;
    (c) proof that the breach caused substantial harm and was not caused by the landlord's own fault.

5. Eviction for landlord's personal use requires:
    (a) proof that the landlord genuinely intends to occupy the dwelling and has no other available dwelling;
    (b) at least six months' advance notice to the tenant;
    (c) payment of relocation assistance equal to three months' rent;
    (d) right of first refusal for the tenant to return if the dwelling becomes available within two years.

6. Eviction for renovation or demolition requires:
    (a) proof that the work is necessary for safety and cannot be performed with the tenant in residence;
    (b) provision of temporary alternative housing or relocation assistance;
    (c) right for the tenant to return after renovation at the same or comparable rent.

7. Landlords may not evict or threaten to evict tenants:
    (a) in retaliation for asserting their rights, filing complaints, or organizing with other tenants;
    (b) based on discriminatory grounds, including race, religion, gender, family status, disability, or source of income;
    (c) during winter months (November through March) or during periods of public health emergency;
    (d) without judicial order obtained through proper legal proceedings.

8. Self-help evictions, including changing locks, shutting off utilities, or removing the tenant's belongings, are strictly prohibited and constitute criminal offenses. Tenants subjected to illegal eviction have the right to immediate reinstatement and substantial damages.

9. Tenants facing eviction have the right to:
    (a) legal representation provided free of charge if they cannot afford counsel;
    (b) a hearing before an impartial tribunal with full opportunity to present evidence and witnesses;
    (c) stay of eviction pending appeal or resolution of disputes;
    (d) relocation assistance and priority access to social housing.

10. Eviction orders must allow reasonable time (at least 30 days) for the tenant to vacate. Enforcement must be carried out humanely, with respect for the tenant's dignity and with arrangements to protect vulnerable persons, including children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.

11. After eviction, the tenant retains the right to recover personal property left in the dwelling and to seek redress for wrongful eviction or procedural violations.
