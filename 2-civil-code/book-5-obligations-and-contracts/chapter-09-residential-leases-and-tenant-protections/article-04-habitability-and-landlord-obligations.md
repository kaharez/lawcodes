# Article 4 – Habitability and Landlord Obligations

1. Every residential dwelling must meet minimum standards of habitability and safety. Landlords have a non-waivable duty to provide and maintain habitable housing.

2. Minimum standards of habitability include:
    a. structural integrity, weatherproofing, and protection from the elements;
    b. adequate heating, ventilation, and natural light;
    c. functioning plumbing, including hot and cold water, sanitation, and drainage;
    d. electrical systems that meet safety codes;
    e. freedom from pest infestation, mold, and health hazards;
    f. adequate space and occupancy limits appropriate to household size;
    g. secure doors and windows providing privacy and security.

3. Landlords must:
    a. maintain the dwelling in habitable condition throughout the lease;
    b. make repairs promptly when notified of defects or hazards;
    c. ensure compliance with building codes, health regulations, and safety standards;
    d. provide essential services, including water, heat, and electricity, without interruption.

4. If the landlord fails to maintain habitability:
    a. the tenant may withhold rent until repairs are made, depositing rent in escrow;
    b. the tenant may make necessary repairs and deduct the cost from rent, after notice to the landlord;
    c. the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty and seek damages;
    d. the tenant may petition the court or housing authority for an order requiring repairs.

5. Landlords are liable for injuries or health problems caused by uninhabitable conditions, including:
    a. personal injury resulting from structural defects, faulty equipment, or hazardous conditions;
    b. illness caused by mold, contamination, or unsanitary conditions;
    c. property damage resulting from leaks, flooding, or landlord negligence;
    d. loss of use or enjoyment of the dwelling.

6. Landlords must give reasonable notice (at least 24 hours except in emergencies) before entering the dwelling and may enter only:
    a. to make necessary repairs or inspections;
    b. to show the dwelling to prospective tenants or purchasers, during reasonable hours;
    c. in case of emergency posing immediate danger to persons or property.

7. Tenants have the right to privacy and peaceful enjoyment of the dwelling. Landlords may not harass tenants, interfere with utilities, or engage in conduct that disturbs the tenant's use and enjoyment.

8. Landlords must maintain common areas, including hallways, stairs, elevators, and grounds, in safe and sanitary condition.

9. Energy efficiency and environmental standards apply to residential dwellings. Landlords must ensure reasonable insulation, efficient heating systems, and compliance with environmental health standards.

10. Landlords who systematically fail to maintain habitable housing or who exploit tenants may face:
    a. fines and penalties imposed by housing authorities;
    b. orders to make repairs or improvements;
    c. appointment of a receiver to manage the property;
    d. suspension or revocation of rental licenses;
    e. expropriation of the property for conversion to social housing.
