# Article 1 – Scope and General Principles

1. This chapter governs residential leases, being leases of dwellings used as the primary residence of natural persons, and establishes protections for tenants in recognition of housing as a fundamental social need.

2. The provisions of this chapter are of public order and may not be waived or circumvented by agreement to the detriment of the tenant. Any clause contrary to the protections established in this chapter is null and void.

3. Housing is a fundamental right. Residential leases shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that ensures:
    (a) security of tenure and protection against arbitrary eviction;
    (b) affordability and protection against excessive rent;
    (c) habitability and decent living conditions;
    (d) non-discrimination and equal access to housing;
    (e) the right to organise and participate in tenant associations.

4. In case of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and general contract law, the provisions of this chapter prevail.

5. Protections established by this chapter apply to all residential leases, whether written or oral, formal or informal. The absence of a written lease does not deprive the tenant of statutory protections.

6. Landlords have corresponding obligations to maintain property, respect tenant rights, and comply with social housing policies. Systematic violation of tenant rights may result in sanctions, including fines, restrictions on rental activity, or expropriation for social housing purposes.

7. Local governments may establish rent control boards, tenant protection agencies, and dispute resolution mechanisms to ensure effective enforcement of tenant rights.

8. Tenants have the right to seek judicial protection and to obtain damages for violations of their rights, without fear of retaliatory eviction or other reprisals.
