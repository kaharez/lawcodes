# Article 2 – Measure of Damages

1. Reparation for damage must, so far as possible, restore the victim to the situation that would have existed had the damage not occurred.

2. Reparation may take the form of:
    a. restoration in kind, by repairing or replacing the damaged thing;
    b. compensation in money, where restoration in kind is impossible, insufficient, or excessively burdensome;
    c. other forms of reparation appropriate to the nature of the damage.

3. Material damage includes both actual loss suffered (damnum emergens) and gain of which the victim was deprived (lucrum cessans), to the extent that they are certain and flow directly from the wrongful act.

4. Future damage that is certain or sufficiently probable may be compensated. Purely speculative or hypothetical damage is not compensable.

5. Compensation for loss of income or earning capacity is calculated according to the victim's actual situation, including age, health, profession, qualifications, and probable career development.

6. Moral damage, including pain and suffering, loss of amenities, and injury to dignity or reputation, may be compensated where the damage is serious and proven. The amount is determined by the court according to the circumstances, the gravity of the fault, and the consequences for the victim.

7. Damages for loss of life suffered by dependents include loss of support and companionship. Funeral expenses and other reasonable costs incurred by the family are also compensable.

8. Where the victim's fault contributed to the damage, compensation is reduced in proportion to the victim's degree of fault. The reduction applies to both material and moral damages.

9. Compensation may be awarded as a lump sum or as periodic payments, depending on the nature of the damage and the circumstances. Periodic payments may be revised in case of substantial change in circumstances.

10. Interest on damages runs from the date of the wrongful act, or from the date of judicial demand if the damage crystallized later.

11. The right to claim damages for personal injury prescribes after three years from the date the victim became aware or should have become aware of the damage and the identity of the person responsible, and in any event after ten years from the date of the wrongful act.

12. For damage to property, the prescriptive period is three years from the date the victim became aware or should have become aware of the damage and the identity of the person responsible.
