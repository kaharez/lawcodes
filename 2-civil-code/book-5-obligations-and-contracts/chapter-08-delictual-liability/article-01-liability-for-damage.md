# Article 1 – Liability for Damage

1. Every person who intentionally or negligently causes damage to another is obliged to make reparation.

2. Fault consists of intent or negligence. Intent exists where a person desires the harmful consequence or accepts it as certain or probable. Negligence exists where a person fails to exercise the care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances.

3. A person is liable for damage caused by their acts or omissions, and also for damage caused by things under their control or by persons for whom they are responsible, in accordance with the rules established in this chapter.

4. No one is liable without fault, except in cases of strict liability expressly provided by law.

5. Persons exercising dangerous activities or having control of dangerous things are strictly liable for damage caused thereby, unless they prove that the damage was caused by force majeure, fault of the victim, or fault of a third party for whom they are not responsible.

6. Parents are liable for damage caused by their minor children living with them. Guardians are liable for damage caused by wards under their authority. Teachers and artisans are liable for damage caused by pupils or apprentices while under their supervision.

7. Liability under the preceding paragraph ceases if the person responsible proves they could not have prevented the damage despite exercising all due care and supervision.

8. Employers and principals are vicariously liable for damage caused by their employees, servants, and agents acting within the scope of their employment or authority.

9. The owner or possessor of an animal is liable for damage caused by the animal, whether under their control or strayed, unless they prove force majeure or fault of the victim.

10. The owner of a building or structure is liable for damage caused by its ruin or defect, unless they prove that the damage did not result from lack of maintenance or defect in construction.

11. Persons jointly responsible for the same damage are solidarily liable toward the victim. As between themselves, liability is apportioned according to the degree of fault of each. Recourse against one who is insolvent is borne by the others in proportion to their fault.

12. The victim may not claim damages to the extent that the damage was caused or contributed to by their own fault. The court shall reduce damages in proportion to the victim's contributory fault.
