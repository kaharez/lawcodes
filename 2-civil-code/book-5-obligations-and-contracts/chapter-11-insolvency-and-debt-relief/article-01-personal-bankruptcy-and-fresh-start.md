# Article 1 – Personal Bankruptcy and Fresh Start

1. Natural persons who are unable to pay their debts as they fall due and whose liabilities exceed their assets may seek relief through personal bankruptcy proceedings, designed to provide a fresh start while ensuring fair treatment of creditors.

2. Personal bankruptcy proceedings include:
    a. liquidation bankruptcy, in which non-exempt assets are distributed to creditors and remaining eligible debts are discharged;
    b. reorganization or repayment plans, in which the debtor proposes a plan to repay debts over time from future income;
    c. the choice between liquidation and reorganization is made by the debtor, subject to court approval and creditor rights.

3. Access to bankruptcy relief is a fundamental right and may not be unduly restricted. Bankruptcy proceedings must be:
    a. accessible, with modest filing fees that may be waived for indigent debtors;
    b. expeditious, with proceedings concluded within a reasonable time;
    c. fair, balancing the interests of honest debtors in obtaining relief with the rights of creditors to fair treatment;
    d. protective of human dignity, prohibiting harsh or punitive treatment of debtors.

4. Exempt property that is protected from creditors includes:
    a. the debtor's primary residence, up to the homestead exemption amount;
    b. essential household goods, furnishings, clothing, and personal effects;
    c. tools of trade and professional equipment necessary for the debtor's livelihood;
    d. one motor vehicle of reasonable value necessary for employment or essential needs;
    e. retirement savings and pension rights, within reasonable limits;
    f. life insurance policies and health savings;
    g. personal injury compensation and damages for pain and suffering;
    h. social benefits, public assistance, and maintenance payments.

5. In liquidation bankruptcy:
    a. non-exempt assets are gathered, liquidated, and distributed to creditors according to statutory priorities;
    b. the debtor retains all exempt property and any property acquired after the bankruptcy filing;
    c. upon completion of liquidation and after a brief period (not exceeding one year), eligible debts are discharged and the debtor receives a fresh start.

6. In reorganization bankruptcy:
    a. the debtor proposes a plan to repay debts from future income over a period of three to five years;
    b. the plan must be feasible, devote the debtor's disposable income to repayment, and treat creditors fairly;
    c. creditors may object to the plan, but the court may approve it over objections if it meets legal requirements and is in good faith;
    d. upon successful completion of the plan, remaining eligible debts are discharged.

7. Debts eligible for discharge include most unsecured consumer debts, including:
    a. credit card debt, personal loans, and medical bills;
    b. deficiency judgments on foreclosed property, subject to anti-deficiency rules;
    c. unpaid rent and utility bills;
    d. tort judgments, except for willful and malicious injury;
    e. most court judgments and civil penalties.

8. Debts not dischargeable include:
    a. debts incurred by fraud, false pretenses, or willful misconduct;
    b. maintenance obligations, child support, and spousal support;
    c. fines and criminal restitution;
    d. debts for willful and malicious injury to persons or property;
    e. student loans, except upon showing of undue hardship;
    f. recent taxes and tax debts secured by liens.

9. The discharge permanently enjoins creditors from attempting to collect discharged debts, including through:
    a. lawsuits, garnishment, or other legal process;
    b. telephone calls, letters, or other communications demanding payment;
    c. setoff or collection from exempt property or future income;
    d. reporting the debt as outstanding to credit bureaus after discharge.

10. Creditors who violate the discharge injunction are subject to contempt sanctions, damages, and attorney's fees.

11. A debtor may obtain a discharge in liquidation bankruptcy once every eight years, but may file for reorganization bankruptcy more frequently if needed.

12. Employers, landlords, government agencies, and others may not discriminate against persons based on bankruptcy filing or discharge. Such discrimination is unlawful and gives rise to civil liability and administrative sanctions.

13. Credit reporting of bankruptcy is limited to seven years for reorganization and ten years for liquidation, after which it must be removed from credit reports.

14. Bankruptcy proceedings are conducted by specialized insolvency courts or tribunals with expertise in debtor-creditor law. Legal assistance and counseling services must be available to debtors who cannot afford private counsel.
