# Article 2 – Binding Force and Good Faith

1. Contracts validly formed are binding upon the parties and must be performed in good faith.

2. Good faith requires the parties to act honestly, fairly, and loyally, respecting the legitimate interests of the other party and cooperating to achieve the purpose of the contract.

3. The duty of good faith applies at all stages of the contractual relationship, including negotiation, formation, performance, and termination.

4. The parties may not evade their obligations by reliance on formal defects, technicalities, or interpretations inconsistent with good faith.

5. A contract may not be unilaterally modified or terminated by one party except where expressly permitted by the contract, by law, or by mutual agreement.

6. Where unforeseen circumstances render performance excessively onerous or defeat the purpose of the contract, the parties must renegotiate in good faith. If renegotiation fails, either party may petition the court for modification or termination of the contract.

7. Contracts have effect between the parties and their successors in title, except where the obligation is personal or the contract expressly excludes successors.

8. Contracts do not bind third parties, except where the law confers rights or imposes obligations upon third parties, or where the contract contains a stipulation in favour of a third party.

9. A stipulation in favour of a third party confers upon the third party an independent right to claim performance, which becomes irrevocable once the third party manifests assent or reliance.

10. Contracts must be performed at the time, place, and in the manner specified. In the absence of specification, performance is due immediately, at the place of business of the debtor, and in the manner customary for such obligations.
