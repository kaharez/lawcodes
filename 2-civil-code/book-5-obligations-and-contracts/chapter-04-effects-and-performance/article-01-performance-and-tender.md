# Article 1 – Performance and Tender

1. An obligation is performed when the debtor delivers or does exactly what was promised, at the proper time, place, and manner.

2. The debtor must perform personally where the contract or the nature of the obligation requires personal performance. Otherwise, the debtor may perform through a third party.

3. Performance must be complete and may not be divided or made in instalments without the consent of the creditor, unless the obligation is divisible by its nature or by agreement.

4. The creditor may refuse partial performance except where the obligation is divisible and acceptance of part does not prejudice their rights.

5. Tender of performance is the offer by the debtor to perform the obligation in the proper manner. A valid tender discharges the debtor from liability for delay and transfers the risk to the creditor if the creditor refuses without justification.

6. Where the creditor refuses a valid tender of performance, the debtor may liberate themselves by depositing the thing owed with the court or a designated depository, at the expense and risk of the creditor.

7. Payment must be made to the creditor or to a person authorised to receive it on behalf of the creditor. Payment made to an unauthorised person does not discharge the obligation, unless the creditor ratifies it or benefits from it.

8. The creditor must issue a receipt upon request. Receipts for periodic payments create a presumption that prior instalments have been paid.

9. The debtor has the right to require proof of the creditor's title and to withhold performance until such proof is provided.

10. Where the creditor has multiple debts owed by the same debtor, the debtor may indicate which debt is being discharged. If no indication is made, payment is applied first to debts that are due, then to the most burdensome, and finally in proportion to all debts.
