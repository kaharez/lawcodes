# Article 4 – Collective Bargaining and Trade Union Rights

1. Workers have the fundamental right to organise, form and join trade unions, and engage in collective bargaining to protect and advance their economic and social interests.

2. Trade union rights include:
    (a) freedom to form unions without prior authorization;
    (b) freedom to join the union of one's choice without discrimination or retaliation;
    (c) freedom for unions to organise, recruit members, and represent workers;
    (d) freedom to elect union representatives democratically;
    (e) protection of union officials and activists from dismissal or discrimination;
    (f) access to workplaces to organise and communicate with workers.

3. Employers must:
    (a) recognise and bargain in good faith with unions representing their workers;
    (b) provide unions with information necessary for meaningful bargaining;
    (c) refrain from interfering with union activities or discriminating against union members;
    (d) allow union representatives reasonable time off with pay for union duties.

4. Collective bargaining covers:
    (a) wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment;
    (b) working hours, overtime, and leave entitlements;
    (c) health and safety standards;
    (d) procedures for discipline, grievances, and dismissals;
    (e) training, career development, and job security;
    (f) workplace reorganization and technological change;
    (g) rights of workers to participate in enterprise decision-making.

5. Collective agreements are legally binding contracts between employers and unions, enforceable through labour tribunals and courts. They take precedence over individual employment contracts where more favourable to workers.

6. Collective agreements apply to all workers in the bargaining unit, whether union members or not. Non-members who benefit from collective agreements may be required to pay fair representation fees.

7. Workers have the right to strike and engage in collective action to advance their interests, subject to reasonable limitations:
    (a) strikes must be decided democratically by affected workers;
    (b) advance notice must be given to the employer and labour authorities;
    (c) essential services must be maintained to protect public health and safety;
    (d) peaceful picketing is permitted.

8. Lockouts by employers are permitted only in response to strikes and under comparable conditions.

9. It is unlawful for employers to:
    (a) dismiss or penalize workers for union membership or activities;
    (b) refuse to hire or promote workers based on union affiliation;
    (c) establish company-dominated unions or interfere in union governance;
    (d) hire replacement workers to break strikes;
    (e) retaliate against workers for exercising their rights to organise or strike.

10. Workers have the right to participate in workplace decision-making through:
    (a) works councils elected by all workers, with rights to information and consultation;
    (b) representation on boards of directors of large enterprises;
    (c) participation in health and safety committees;
    (d) consultation on matters affecting employment, including restructuring and technological change.

11. Labour authorities and courts have a duty to facilitate collective bargaining, mediate disputes, and protect the right to organise. Anti-union discrimination is subject to substantial penalties and criminal sanctions.

12. In sectors where collective bargaining coverage is low, the government may extend collective agreements to entire industries or sectors to ensure fair wages and conditions for all workers.
