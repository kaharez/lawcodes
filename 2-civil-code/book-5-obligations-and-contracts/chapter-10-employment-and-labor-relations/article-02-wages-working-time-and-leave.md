# Article 2 – Wages, Working Time, and Leave

1. All workers are entitled to a minimum wage established by law, sufficient to ensure a decent standard of living for the worker and their family. The minimum wage is adjusted annually to reflect inflation and productivity growth.

2. Workers are entitled to equal pay for equal work. Wage differentials based on gender, race, or other prohibited grounds are unlawful and give rise to claims for back pay and damages.

3. Wages must be paid:
    (a) in full, in legal currency, at regular intervals not exceeding one month;
    (b) directly to the worker, not to intermediaries;
    (c) with a detailed payslip showing gross pay, deductions, and net pay.

4. Unauthorized deductions from wages are prohibited. Permitted deductions include only:
    (a) taxes and social security contributions required by law;
    (b) union dues authorized by the worker;
    (c) court-ordered garnishments;
    (d) repayment of advances, with the worker's written consent and limited to a reasonable percentage of wages.

5. Normal working hours are limited to:
    (a) eight hours per day and forty hours per week;
    (b) with mandatory rest breaks of at least thirty minutes for each four hours worked.

6. Overtime work exceeding normal hours requires the worker's consent and is compensated at:
    (a) one and one-half times the regular wage for overtime on weekdays;
    (b) double the regular wage for work on weekends and public holidays.

7. Overtime is limited to a maximum of ten hours per week, except in emergencies. Systematic overtime to avoid hiring additional workers is prohibited.

8. Workers are entitled to:
    (a) at least twenty-four consecutive hours of rest each week, preferably on Sunday or the worker's day of religious observance;
    (b) at least twenty working days of paid annual leave, increasing with length of service;
    (c) public holidays as designated by law, with pay;
    (d) paid sick leave of at least ten days per year, with medical certification;
    (e) maternity leave of at least fourteen weeks with full pay, and parental leave as provided by law;
    (f) compassionate leave for family emergencies, bereavement, and family care responsibilities.

9. Night work, shift work, and work under hazardous conditions entitle workers to additional compensation, reduced hours, and enhanced protections.

10. Workers may not be compelled to work beyond normal hours, on rest days, or during leave, except in genuine emergencies. Refusal to work excessive hours is not grounds for discipline or dismissal.

11. Unpaid internships and apprenticeships are prohibited except in educational contexts with genuine learning objectives. Trainees and interns performing productive work must be compensated at least at the minimum wage.
