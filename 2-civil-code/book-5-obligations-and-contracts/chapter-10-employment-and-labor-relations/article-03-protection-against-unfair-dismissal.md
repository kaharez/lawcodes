# Article 3 – Protection Against Unfair Dismissal

1. Workers have a right to security of employment and may be dismissed only for just cause or economic necessity, after fair procedures.

2. Just causes for dismissal include only:
    (a) serious misconduct, including theft, violence, serious insubordination, or gross negligence;
    (b) persistent poor performance despite warnings and opportunity to improve;
    (c) incapacity to perform essential duties, not remediable by accommodation or reassignment.

3. Economic dismissals due to redundancy, restructuring, or business closure are permitted only if:
    (a) the employer demonstrates genuine economic necessity;
    (b) less drastic alternatives, including reduced hours or voluntary departures, have been exhausted;
    (c) the selection of workers for dismissal is fair and based on objective criteria;
    (d) consultation with affected workers and their unions has occurred;
    (e) severance pay and reemployment assistance are provided.

4. Dismissal procedures require:
    (a) written notice specifying the grounds for dismissal;
    (b) opportunity for the worker to respond and present their case;
    (c) consideration of the worker's length of service, circumstances, and alternative measures;
    (d) a written decision stating reasons.

5. Notice periods for dismissal are:
    (a) one month for workers employed less than one year;
    (b) two months for workers employed between one and five years;
    (c) three months for workers employed more than five years;
    (d) longer periods as provided by collective agreement or employment contract.

6. During notice, workers are entitled to full pay and reasonable time off to seek new employment.

7. Dismissal without notice (summary dismissal) is permitted only for the most serious misconduct and must be justified by objective evidence.

8. Severance pay is owed to workers dismissed for economic reasons, calculated as:
    (a) one month's wages for each year of service;
    (b) minimum of three months' wages regardless of service length;
    (c) enhanced severance for older workers or those with long service.

9. Dismissal is unlawful if motivated by:
    (a) union membership, union activities, or participation in collective bargaining;
    (b) filing complaints about working conditions or asserting legal rights;
    (c) pregnancy, maternity leave, or family responsibilities;
    (d) disability, illness, or exercise of right to sick leave;
    (e) race, gender, religion, or other prohibited grounds of discrimination;
    (f) political opinion or social origin.

10. Workers unlawfully dismissed have the right to:
    (a) reinstatement to their former position with back pay and benefits;
    (b) alternatively, compensation of at least six months' wages plus severance pay;
    (c) damages for injury to dignity, reputation, and emotional distress.

11. The burden of proving just cause for dismissal rests on the employer. Dismissals are presumed unfair unless the employer proves otherwise.

12. Workers may challenge dismissals through:
    (a) internal grievance procedures;
    (b) labour tribunals or courts with expedited procedures;
    (c) mediation and conciliation services.

13. During pendency of unfair dismissal proceedings, workers may seek interim relief, including reinstatement or continued pay, to prevent irreparable harm.

14. Employers who engage in systematic unfair dismissals or union-busting may face enhanced penalties, including criminal sanctions against responsible managers.
