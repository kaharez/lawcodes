# Article 3 – Object and Cause

1. Every contract must have an object consisting of the performance or forbearance to which the parties are bound.

2. The object of a contract must be:
    (a) possible, both physically and legally;
    (b) lawful, not contrary to law, public order, or morals;
    (c) sufficiently determined or determinable by the terms of the contract or by reference to external criteria.

3. A contract whose object is impossible, unlawful, or indeterminate is null and void.

4. Future things or rights may be the object of a contract, provided they are capable of determination and not contrary to law.

5. Every contract must have a cause, being the immediate purpose or juridical reason for which the obligation is undertaken.

6. The cause must be:
    (a) real, actually existing and not simulated;
    (b) lawful, not contrary to law, public order, or morals;
    (c) adequate to justify the obligation.

7. A contract lacking cause, or whose cause is unlawful or contrary to public order, is null and void.

8. The motive for entering into a contract is not the cause, except where the motive is expressly made a condition of the contract or is unlawful and known to both parties.

9. Where a contract is null for want of object or cause, no obligation arises and any performance rendered must be restored, subject to the rules on restitution for unlawful contracts.

10. Unlawful contracts do not give rise to restitution in favour of a party who acted with knowledge of the unlawfulness, except where necessary to prevent unjust enrichment or to protect third parties acting in good faith.
