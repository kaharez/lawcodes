# Article 1 – Offer and Acceptance

1. A contract is formed by the acceptance of an offer, manifesting the mutual consent of the parties to be bound by the terms proposed.

2. An offer is a proposal to enter into a contract, sufficiently definite and indicating the intention to be bound if accepted.

3. An offer may be made to a specific person, to a class of persons, or to the public at large. It becomes effective when it reaches the offeree or is made public.

4. An offer may be revoked at any time before acceptance, unless:
    a. the offer states that it is irrevocable or specifies a period for acceptance;
    b. the offeree has reasonably relied upon the offer to their detriment;
    c. acceptance has already been dispatched.

5. An offer lapses and ceases to have effect if:
    a. it is rejected by the offeree;
    b. the period for acceptance expires without acceptance being communicated;
    c. the offeror or offeree dies or loses legal capacity before acceptance, unless the offer was made in the course of trade or profession.

6. Acceptance is a statement or conduct by the offeree indicating assent to the offer. It must be clear, unequivocal, and communicated to the offeror.

7. Acceptance must conform to the terms of the offer. A purported acceptance that modifies or adds terms constitutes a counter-offer, which must itself be accepted to form a contract.

8. Unless otherwise required by the offer or by law, acceptance may be communicated by any means, including conduct or performance.

9. Acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeror, unless the offer permits acceptance by conduct or performance, in which case acceptance is effective upon commencement of performance.

10. A contract is formed at the time and place where acceptance becomes effective, unless the parties agree otherwise or the law provides otherwise.
