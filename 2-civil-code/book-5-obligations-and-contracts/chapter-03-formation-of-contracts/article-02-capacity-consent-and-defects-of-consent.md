# Article 2 – Capacity, Consent, and Defects of Consent

1. A person must have legal capacity to enter into a contract. Lack of capacity renders the contract voidable at the instance of the incapable party or their legal representative.

2. Minors and persons under guardianship lack full capacity to contract, except as provided by law for ordinary acts of daily life or contracts beneficial to them.

3. Consent must be free, informed, and genuine. Consent is defective and the contract voidable if it is vitiated by error, fraud, duress, or undue influence.

4. Error as to the nature of the contract or the identity of the other party renders the contract void. Error as to a material quality of the object or person renders the contract voidable if:
    (a) the error relates to an essential quality that determined consent;
    (b) the other party knew or ought to have known of the error and its importance.

5. Error as to the value of the object or error of law does not vitiate consent, except where the error of law was the sole cause of the contract and relates to the application of the law to the facts.

6. Fraud consists of intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material facts for the purpose of deceiving the other party. A contract induced by fraud is voidable at the instance of the defrauded party.

7. Duress consists of threats or violence that inspire a reasonable fear of serious harm to person or property, leaving the victim no reasonable alternative but to consent. A contract concluded under duress is voidable.

8. Undue influence consists of the improper use of a relationship of trust, authority, or dependency to obtain consent. A contract concluded under undue influence is voidable.

9. The right to avoid a contract for defect of consent must be exercised within a reasonable time after discovery of the error, fraud, duress, or undue influence, and in any event within three years of the conclusion of the contract.

10. Upon avoidance of a contract, the parties are restored to their original positions as far as possible. The party responsible for the defect may be liable for damages.
