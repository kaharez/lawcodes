# Article 2 – Extinction of Obligations

1. Obligations are extinguished by:
    (a) performance;
    (b) novation;
    (c) compensation (set-off);
    (d) confusion (merger);
    (e) remission of debt;
    (f) impossibility of performance;
    (g) prescription;
    (h) other means provided by law or agreement.

2. Novation is the extinction of an existing obligation and its replacement by a new obligation differing in object, cause, or parties. Novation requires the clear intention of the parties to extinguish the original obligation.

3. Novation may occur by:
    (a) substitution of a new debtor with the consent of the creditor and release of the original debtor;
    (b) substitution of a new creditor with the consent of the debtor;
    (c) change in the essential elements of the obligation.

4. Compensation occurs automatically when two persons are mutually debtors and creditors of obligations that are fungible, due, and liquidated. Each obligation is extinguished to the extent of the lesser amount.

5. Compensation operates by operation of law even if the parties are unaware, provided the conditions are met. The right to plead compensation does not require prior demand or judicial decree.

6. Confusion occurs when the qualities of creditor and debtor are united in the same person, causing the obligation to be extinguished. Confusion may arise by succession, merger of legal entities, or other juridical acts.

7. Remission of debt is the voluntary renunciation by the creditor of their right to claim performance. It may be express or implied from conduct indicating an intention to release the debtor.

8. Remission must be accepted by the debtor to be effective. Return of the instrument evidencing the debt creates a presumption of remission.

9. Prescription is the extinction of the right to claim performance after the lapse of the period prescribed by law, combined with inaction by the creditor.

10. The general prescriptive period for obligations is ten years. Shorter periods apply to specific types of obligations as provided by law. Prescription is suspended during periods when the creditor is unable to act and is interrupted by judicial claim or acknowledgment by the debtor.

11. Parties may not by agreement shorten or extend prescriptive periods established by law, but the debtor may renounce the benefit of prescription after it has run.
