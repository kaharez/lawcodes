# Article 1 – Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Obligations

1. A creditor may assign their rights under a contract to a third party without the consent of the debtor, unless the assignment is prohibited by law, contract, or the nature of the obligation.

2. Assignment is effected by agreement between the assignor and assignee. It becomes effective against the debtor when notice of the assignment is given to the debtor.

3. The assignee acquires the right in the same condition as it existed in the hands of the assignor, subject to all defences and claims that the debtor could have raised against the assignor.

4. The assignor warrants that the right assigned exists and is valid, but does not warrant the solvency of the debtor unless expressly undertaken.

5. Personal rights and obligations that are not transferable by their nature or by agreement may not be assigned. Examples include maintenance rights, personal injury claims, and contracts for personal services.

6. The debtor may delegate performance of their obligation to a third party, but the delegation does not release the debtor unless the creditor expressly consents to the substitution.

7. Where the creditor consents to the substitution of a new debtor, the original debtor is released and the new debtor assumes all obligations, unless otherwise agreed. Such substitution is called novation by change of debtor.

8. Assignment of rights and delegation of obligations in bilateral contracts transfers or delegates the entire contractual relationship, unless otherwise provided.

9. The assignee or delegate must give notice to the other party and may be required to provide adequate assurance of performance.

10. Multiple assignments of the same right are ranked by priority of notice to the debtor. The first assignee to give notice has priority, unless a later assignee has acquired the right in good faith for value without notice of the prior assignment.
