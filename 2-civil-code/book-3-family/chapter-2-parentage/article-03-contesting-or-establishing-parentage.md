# Article 3 – Contesting or Establishing Parentage

1. Parentage may be contested by those whose status is directly affected, or by the Royal Chancellery where public order so requires.
2. Parentage may be established by petition to the Chancellery supported by relevant evidence, including genetic testing or sworn declarations, and confirmed by decree.
3. Decisions regarding parentage shall prioritise the welfare and best interests of the child.
