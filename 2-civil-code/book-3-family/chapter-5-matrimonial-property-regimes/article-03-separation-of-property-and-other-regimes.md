# Article 3 – Separation of Property and Other Regimes

1. Under the regime of separation of property, each spouse retains ownership and independent management of their own property, whether acquired before or during marriage.

2. Each spouse is solely liable for their own debts. Creditors of one spouse may not seize the property of the other, except for debts incurred jointly or for the benefit of the family.

3. Property held in the name of one spouse is presumed to belong to that spouse. Property acquired jointly is held in co-ownership in equal shares unless otherwise proven.

4. During marriage under separation of property, each spouse may freely manage, alienate, and encumber their property without the consent of the other, subject to any restrictions agreed in the matrimonial agreement or imposed by law.

5. Upon dissolution of marriage, each spouse retains their own property. There is no liquidation or partition, except for property held in co-ownership, which is divided in accordance with the rules governing co-ownership.

6. Spouses may adopt a regime of participation in acquests, whereby each spouse manages their property separately during marriage, but upon dissolution, the net gains acquired by each spouse during marriage are calculated and equalized, so that each spouse receives half of the total net gains.

7. Net gains consist of the final value of the property owned at dissolution, minus the initial value at the beginning of the regime, minus debts, plus dissipated assets and gifts not justified by the matrimonial relationship.

8. The calculation and equalization of gains are performed in accordance with detailed rules established by law or the matrimonial agreement.

9. Spouses may agree to a customized regime, combining elements of different regimes or establishing specific rules for particular assets, provided the regime is not contrary to law, public order, or the essential rights and duties of marriage.

10. The matrimonial agreement may establish rules for contributions to family expenses, use of the family home, management of specific assets, and other matters relevant to the property relations of the spouses.
