# Article 2 – Community of Acquests

1. Under the regime of community of acquests, property acquired by either spouse during marriage forms part of the community and belongs to both spouses equally, subject to the exceptions established in this article.

2. The following property remains the separate property of each spouse:
    a. property owned before marriage;
    b. property acquired during marriage by gift, inheritance, or legacy, unless the donor or testator expressly provided otherwise;
    c. personal effects and property for professional use;
    d. compensation for personal injury;
    e. property acquired in exchange for or with the proceeds of separate property.

3. Community property includes:
    a. all property acquired by either spouse during marriage from their work, business, or profession;
    b. income and fruits generated by separate property during marriage;
    c. property acquired during marriage that is not separate property under paragraph 2.

4. Each spouse has the power to manage and administer their separate property independently. Community property is managed jointly by both spouses, or by one spouse with the express or implied consent of the other for ordinary acts of administration.

5. Acts of disposition of community property, including alienation, encumbrance, or lease for more than three years, require the consent of both spouses. Acts performed without the required consent are voidable at the instance of the non-consenting spouse within two years.

6. Each spouse is personally liable for debts incurred before marriage or for personal obligations. Community property is liable for debts incurred by either spouse for the benefit of the family or in the ordinary course of administration, and for debts incurred by both spouses jointly.

7. Upon dissolution of the regime, the community is liquidated. Each spouse or their heirs is entitled to reclaim their separate property. Community property is divided equally between the spouses or their heirs, after payment of community debts.

8. If one spouse has mismanaged community property or dissipated community assets without the consent of the other, the non-offending spouse is entitled to compensation from the offending spouse's share upon liquidation.
