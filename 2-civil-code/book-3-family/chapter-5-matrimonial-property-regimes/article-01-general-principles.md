# Article 1 – General Principles

1. The matrimonial property regime governs the property relations between spouses during marriage and upon dissolution.

2. Spouses are free to choose their matrimonial property regime by agreement concluded before or during marriage, subject to the limitations imposed by law and public order.

3. In the absence of a matrimonial agreement, the regime of community of acquests applies by operation of law.

4. A matrimonial agreement must be executed in writing before a notary and registered with the civil registry to be effective against third parties.

5. During marriage, spouses may modify their matrimonial property regime by mutual agreement executed in the same form as the original agreement, provided the modification does not prejudice the rights of creditors.

6. The matrimonial property regime does not affect the capacity of each spouse to own, acquire, manage, and dispose of their own property. Each spouse retains full legal capacity and may engage in all juridical acts without the consent of the other, subject to specific restrictions imposed by law or the matrimonial agreement.

7. Notwithstanding the chosen regime, spouses owe each other duties of mutual support and contribution to family expenses according to their respective means.

8. Upon dissolution of marriage by death, divorce, or judicial separation, the matrimonial property regime is liquidated in accordance with the rules governing the regime and the provisions of succession law.

9. The rules governing matrimonial property regimes apply mutatis mutandis to registered civil unions, unless otherwise provided.
