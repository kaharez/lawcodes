# Article 2 – Administration of the Child's Property

1. Parents have the right and duty to administer the property of their minor children with the care of a prudent administrator.

2. Acts of ordinary administration may be performed by either parent independently. Acts of extraordinary administration, including alienation, encumbrance, or long-term lease of immovable property or valuable assets, require the consent of both parents and authorization by the competent authority.

3. Parents must preserve the capital of the child's property and may not use it for their own benefit or the benefit of others, except as necessary for the maintenance and education of the child.

4. Parents are entitled to the usufruct of the child's property, meaning they may use the property and receive its fruits and income, provided they apply the income first to the maintenance and education of the child.

5. The usufruct of parents does not extend to:
    a. property acquired by the child through their own work or profession;
    b. property left or given to the child with the express exclusion of parental usufruct;
    c. property acquired by the child through inheritance when the parents are excluded or unworthy to inherit.

6. Parents must maintain accounts of their administration and must render accounts to the child upon termination of parental authority or at the request of the competent authority.

7. Parents are liable for loss or damage to the child's property resulting from their fault or negligence in administration. They are not liable for loss resulting from force majeure or circumstances beyond their control.

8. Upon termination of parental authority, parents must deliver the child's property to the child or their legal representative, along with an accounting. If the property has been diminished by fault of the parents, they must compensate the child.

9. The child, upon attaining majority, may ratify acts of administration performed by the parents or may challenge acts that were not in the child's interest or that exceeded the scope of parental authority.

10. Where parents are manifestly incapable of administering the child's property, or have mismanaged it to the prejudice of the child, the competent authority may appoint an administrator or limit the scope of parental administration.
