# Article 1 – Exercise of Parental Authority

1. Parental authority is the ensemble of rights and duties of parents toward their minor children, aimed at protecting, educating, and representing them.

2. Parental authority is exercised jointly by both parents, whether married or unmarried, as long as the parentage of both is established and neither has been deprived of authority.

3. In case of disagreement between parents on matters of importance, either parent may petition the competent authority to resolve the dispute in the best interest of the child.

4. A parent who has been deprived of parental authority by judicial decree, or who has abandoned the child, loses the right to exercise authority. Authority may be restored by judicial decree upon proof of changed circumstances.

5. In the event of death, incapacity, or deprivation of one parent, parental authority is exercised exclusively by the surviving or capable parent, unless the child is placed under guardianship.

6. Parents have the duty to provide for the care, maintenance, education, and moral and spiritual development of the child, in accordance with the child's age, needs, and best interests.

7. Parents have the right to determine the place of residence of the child, the mode of education, and other matters concerning the upbringing and welfare of the child, provided such decisions are reasonable and in the child's best interest.

8. Parents have the duty to supervise the conduct of the child and to prevent the child from causing harm to others. Parents may be held vicariously liable for damage caused by the child if they failed to exercise adequate supervision.

9. Parents are the legal representatives of the child and exercise the child's rights on their behalf. Acts performed by parents within the scope of their representative authority bind the child, provided the acts are in the child's interest.

10. Parental authority terminates upon the child attaining majority, marriage of the child, emancipation by judicial decree, or death of the child or parents. It may also be terminated or limited by judicial decree in cases of abuse, neglect, or other conduct harmful to the child.
