# Article 3 – Emancipation

1. Emancipation is the termination of parental authority before the child attains majority, conferring upon the child limited legal capacity.

2. Emancipation occurs automatically upon:
    a. marriage of the minor;
    b. death of both parents, if the minor is not placed under guardianship.

3. Emancipation may be granted by judicial decree upon petition of the minor or the parents, if the minor has attained the age of sixteen years and emancipation is in the minor's interest.

4. An emancipated minor acquires the capacity to perform acts of ordinary administration and to engage in a trade or profession, but may not perform acts of extraordinary administration without judicial authorization.

5. Acts of extraordinary administration include:
    a. alienation, encumbrance, or long-term lease of immovable property;
    b. alienation of business assets or valuable movable property;
    c. borrowing, lending, or standing surety;
    d. accepting or renouncing an inheritance or legacy;
    e. other acts that could substantially affect the minor's financial position.

6. An emancipated minor may not contract marriage or adopt without the consent of the parents or judicial authorization.

7. Emancipation is irrevocable. Once granted, it continues until the minor attains majority, even if the circumstances that justified it cease to exist.

8. An emancipated minor is liable for their own acts and obligations. Parents are relieved of vicarious liability for acts committed by the emancipated minor, except for obligations arising before emancipation.

9. Upon attaining majority, the person acquires full legal capacity and all restrictions imposed by emancipation cease.
