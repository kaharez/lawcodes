1. Marriage creates mutual duties of respect, fidelity, and support between spouses.
2. Each spouse retains full civil capacity and ownership of property, subject to any matrimonial agreements concluded before or during the marriage.
3. Spouses may declare a common surname before the Chancellery; absent such declaration, each spouse retains their own surname.
4. Children born during the marriage are presumed to be the legitimate children of both spouses unless otherwise established by decree or adjudication.
