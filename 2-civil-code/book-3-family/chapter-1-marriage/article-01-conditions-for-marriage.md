# Article 1 – Conditions for Marriage

1. Marriage is a civil institution recognised under the laws of the state of Kaharagia and may be contracted by two persons, without distinction as to sex.

2. Both parties must have attained the age of majority (eighteen years), except where the Sovereign, upon petition to the Royal Chancellery, authorises the marriage of a minor for exceptional reasons. In no case may the Sovereign authorize marriage where either party is under the age of sixteen years.

3. Authorization of marriage of a minor does not affect or diminish criminal protections afforded to persons under the age of eighteen years under the Criminal Code. Marriage does not constitute consent for the purposes of criminal law relating to sexual offences where either party is under the age of eighteen years.

4. Marriage requires the free and mutual consent of both parties, personally expressed before an authorised officiant.

5. Impediments to marriage include:
    (a) an existing marriage or civil union;
    (b) direct lineal kinship between the parties;
    (c) collateral kinship up to and including siblings;
    (d) other impediments established by law or sovereign decree in the interest of morality or public order.
