1. Adoption in the state of Kaharagia is plenary; the adopted person assumes the legal status of child in the adoptive family, and previous parental ties are severed.
2. Adoption creates the same rights and duties between adoptive parent(s) and child as parentage by birth, including name, succession, and civil obligations.
