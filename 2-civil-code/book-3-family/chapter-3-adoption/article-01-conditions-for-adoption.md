# Article 1 – Conditions for Adoption

1. Any person of majority age may petition to adopt; adoption of a minor shall require proof of capacity to provide care and support.
2. Adoption of an adult shall be permitted only for exceptional reasons, including the transmission of heraldic arms or noble title, and must be expressly authorised by sovereign decree.
3. Adoption is prohibited between spouses and between persons in the direct ascending or descending line. Adoption between siblings or close relatives shall be permitted only when it serves the welfare of the minor and is authorised by decree.
