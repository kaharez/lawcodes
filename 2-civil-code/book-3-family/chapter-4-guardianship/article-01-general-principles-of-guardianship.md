1. Guardianship ensures the protection and representation of minors who lack legal capacity to care for themselves or manage their affairs.
2. Guardianship shall be exercised in the best interests of the ward, with respect for their dignity, welfare, and personal development.
3. The Royal Chancellery supervises all guardianships and may issue instructions, require reports, and intervene when necessary to safeguard the ward.
