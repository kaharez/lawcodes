# Article 1 – Nationality

1. Kaharagian nationality is a personal and enduring legal bond that joins an individual to the Sovereign and to the community of Kaharagian nationals.

2. It is founded upon the consent of the Sovereign and the acceptance of the individual, and is independent of territory or residence.

3. The possession of Kaharagian nationality establishes personal status under the laws of the state, entitling the national to recognition in civil matters recorded by the Chancellery, eligibility for national honours and heraldic registrations, participation in cultural and civic institutions, and access to the rights, privileges, and obligations conferred by Kaharagian law.

4. Possession of nationality implies a duty of loyalty to the Sovereign and respect for the laws, symbols, and institutions of the state.

5. Kaharagian nationality is distinct and autonomous from any other nationality and does not affect or preclude the possession of foreign nationality, unless otherwise provided by sovereign decree or treaty.

6. The existence and continuity of Kaharagian nationality are unaffected by the absence or acquisition of territorial sovereignty.

7. The legal status of nationality is evidenced exclusively by registration in the National Register of Kaharagian Nationals, maintained and authenticated by the Secretariat of State. Extracts and certificates issued from this Register shall constitute official proof of nationality.

8. Acquisition and loss of nationality are governed by the provisions that follow.
