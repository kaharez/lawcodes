# Article 4 – Voluntary Renunciation

1. A Kaharagian national who also holds another nationality may petition the Sovereign, through the Royal Chancellery, for permission to renounce Kaharagian nationality. The petition shall take the form of a formal declaration of renunciation addressed to the Sovereign and filed with the Chancellery. The Royal Chancellery shall determine the documents, evidence, and formalities required to accompany such petitions, and may issue regulations to that effect.

2. Renunciation shall take effect only upon acceptance by sovereign decree, which constitutes the highest legal authority for terminating nationality.

3. The decree of renunciation shall be published in the Royal Kaharagian Gazette to serve as public notice and recorded in the National Register of Kaharagian Nationals to constitute definitive legal proof.

4. Renunciation shall not be accepted if it would render the person stateless, unless the Sovereign expressly authorises such renunciation for exceptional reasons.

5. The renunciation of nationality by a parent shall not affect the nationality of their minor children, except where expressly provided by decree and in accordance with the best interests of the child.
