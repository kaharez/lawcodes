# Article 2 – Acquisition of Nationality

1. Nationality of the state of Kaharagia may be acquired only in the forms and under the conditions established by this Code.

2. Nationality may be acquired:
    (a)  By descent, at birth, from at least one parent who is a Kaharagian national at the time of the child’s birth;
    (b) By legal adoption, where a Kaharagian national fully adopts a minor child in accordance with the laws of the state;
    (c) by marriage, where a foreign spouse is admitted to nationality upon sovereign decree following a valid union with a Kaharagian national;
    (d) by grant, through naturalisation or exceptional favour, conferred individually by decree of the Sovereign.

3.  Every acquisition of nationality shall originate in a sovereign decree, which constitutes the highest legal authority for conferring nationality. Such decrees shall be published in the Royal Kaharagian Gazette to serve as public notice and recorded in the National Register of Kaharagian Nationals to constitute definitive legal proof.

4. No private agreement, customary practice, or foreign recognition shall confer Kaharagian nationality. All claims to nationality must arise solely through the procedures established by this Code.

5. When a person is granted Kaharagian nationality under sub‑paragraphs (b), (c), or (d), any of their children who are minors at the time of the decree shall likewise acquire Kaharagian nationality, provided that:
    (a) Parental rights or custody are vested in the new national; and
    (b) The child is recorded in the National Register of Kaharagian Nationals.
