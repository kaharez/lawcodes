# Article 5 – Duties and Powers of Curator, Tutor, or Advisor

1. The curator, tutor, or advisor owes a fiduciary duty to the protected person and must act with loyalty, prudence, diligence, and honesty, in good faith, and in the best interests of the protected person.

2. In exercising their duties, the curator, tutor, or advisor must:
    (a) respect the dignity, autonomy, and rights of the protected person;
    (b) consult the protected person and take into account their wishes, values, and preferences to the extent possible;
    (c) encourage the protected person to exercise their remaining capacities and participate in decisions;
    (d) maintain personal contact with the protected person and be informed of their condition and needs;
    (e) act in the least restrictive manner consistent with the protected person's best interests.

3. A curator or tutor to the person is responsible for:
    (a) ensuring the protected person's personal care, health, safety, and well-being;
    (b) making decisions concerning the person's residence, medical treatment, and personal matters;
    (c) maintaining and fostering the person's relationships with family and friends;
    (d) ensuring the person has access to appropriate services, support, and social activities.

4. Medical treatment decisions require the informed consent of the curator or tutor, except:
    (a) in emergencies where delay would endanger the person's life or health;
    (b) for routine or minor treatments;
    (c) where the protected person is capable of consenting to the specific treatment and expresses a clear wish.

5. Decisions concerning serious medical interventions, institutionalization, or other matters gravely affecting the person's rights require prior authorization by the court or supervisory authority.

6. A curator or tutor to property is responsible for:
    (a) prudently managing and preserving the protected person's property;
    (b) collecting income and paying debts and expenses;
    (c) investing funds in accordance with prudent investment principles;
    (d) maintaining adequate insurance;
    (e) keeping accurate accounts and records of all transactions.

    (d) render an annual account to the court or supervisory authority and, upon request, to the protected person or family members.

8. A judicial advisor assists the protected person in making decisions and performing acts for which assistance is required, provides advice and information, and may represent the person when authorized. The advisor does not substitute for the person's decision-making but supports and facilitates it.

    (a) failure to perform duties;
    (b) misconduct, abuse, or neglect;
