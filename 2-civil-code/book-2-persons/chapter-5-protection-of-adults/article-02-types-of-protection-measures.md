# Article 2 – Types of Protection Measures

1. Protection of an adult may take the following forms:
    (a) curatorship to the person, to the property, or to both;
    (b) tutorship to adults, for persons requiring less restrictive protection;
    (c) judicial advisor or counselor, who assists the person without substituting for their decision-making;
    (d) recognition and homologation of a mandate given in anticipation of incapacity;
    (e) such other measures as are appropriate to the degree and nature of the person's incapacity.

2. Curatorship to the person is appointed when the protected person is unable to care for themselves and make decisions concerning their personal well-being, health, and living arrangements. The curator makes decisions on behalf of the person, in consultation with the person to the extent possible and in their best interests.

3. Curatorship to property is appointed when the protected person is unable to administer their property and financial affairs. The curator manages the property on behalf of the person, with a duty to preserve it and use it for the person's benefit.

4. Tutorship to adults is a less restrictive measure appropriate for persons who require assistance but retain substantial capacity. The tutor assists and advises the person and may represent them for specified acts, but the person retains capacity for other acts.

5. A judicial advisor is appointed to assist a person who retains capacity but requires support in making certain decisions or managing certain affairs. Acts performed with the assistance of the advisor are valid; acts performed without such assistance may be subject to review.

6. A mandate given in anticipation of incapacity is a power of attorney or similar instrument by which a person, while still capable, designates a mandatary to act on their behalf in the event of their future incapacity. The mandate is activated upon a determination of incapacity and allows the mandatary to act without the need for curatorship or tutorship.

7. The court or competent authority shall select the least restrictive form of protection that is adequate to protect the person's interests, taking into account the nature and degree of incapacity, the person's wishes and preferences, and the availability of less formal support.
