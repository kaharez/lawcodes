# Article 6 – Review, Modification, and Termination of Protection

1. Protection measures are subject to periodic review by the court or supervisory authority at intervals not exceeding three years, or more frequently if circumstances require.

2. The protected person, the curator, tutor, advisor, family members, or the public authority may at any time apply for review, modification, or termination of the protection measure.

3. Upon review, the court or authority may:
    (a) confirm the protection measure as it stands;
    (b) modify the measure to make it more or less restrictive, depending on changes in the person's condition or circumstances;
    (c) replace one form of protection with another more appropriate form;
    (d) change the curator, tutor, or advisor;
    (e) terminate the protection measure if it is no longer necessary.

4. The protection measure shall be terminated if:
    (a) the protected person has regained capacity to care for themselves or administer their property;
    (b) the reasons for which protection was instituted no longer exist;
    (c) the protected person dies.

5. Upon termination of protection, the protected person regains full capacity and the curator, tutor, or advisor ceases to have authority. The curator or tutor to property must render a final account, return the property to the person, and obtain a discharge.

6. Acts performed by the protected person during the period of protection are valid to the extent that they were within the person's residual capacity or were ratified by the curator or tutor. Acts performed in excess of capacity may be annulled upon application by the protected person after termination of protection, the curator or tutor, or interested parties, unless they are beneficial to the protected person or third parties dealt in good faith.

7. Upon regaining capacity, the protected person may ratify acts that were performed without proper authorization and thereby render them valid.
