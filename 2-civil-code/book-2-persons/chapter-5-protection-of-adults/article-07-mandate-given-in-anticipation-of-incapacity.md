# Article 7 – Mandate Given in Anticipation of Incapacity

1. Any person of full age and capacity may, by notarial act or other solemn instrument, give a mandate authorizing another person (the mandatary) to act on their behalf in the event of their future incapacity.

2. The mandate must specify:
    a. the identity of the mandatary and any alternate mandataries;
    b. the scope of the mandatary's powers, which may extend to personal care, property administration, or both;
    c. any conditions, limitations, or instructions governing the exercise of the powers;
    d. the circumstances or criteria for determining when the mandate becomes effective (activation).

3. The mandate may include:
    a. the mandator's wishes and preferences concerning personal care, medical treatment, living arrangements, and end-of-life decisions;
    b. instructions concerning property management and financial affairs;
    c. gifts, donations, or other dispositions the mandatary is authorized to make on behalf of the mandator.

4. The mandate takes effect upon:
    a. a determination of the mandator's incapacity, made by medical evaluation or as specified in the mandate; and
    b. homologation (judicial validation) of the mandate by the court or competent authority, unless homologation is waived by law or the mandate.

5. Upon application by the mandatary, a family member, or the public authority, the court shall homologate the mandate if satisfied that:
    a. the mandate was validly executed when the mandator was capable;
    b. the mandator is now incapable within the meaning of the mandate;
    c. the mandatary is suitable and willing to act;
    d. homologation is in the mandator's best interests.

6. Once the mandate is activated, the mandatary has the authority specified in the mandate and must act in accordance with the mandator's instructions, wishes, and best interests. The mandatary owes fiduciary duties equivalent to those of a curator or tutor.

7. A mandate in anticipation of incapacity takes precedence over curatorship or tutorship. Where a valid mandate exists and is activated, there is no need to institute curatorship or tutorship, unless:
    a. the mandate is insufficient to address the person's needs;
    b. the mandatary is unable or unwilling to act, or is acting improperly;
    c. the interests of the incapable person require additional protection.

8. The mandatary must render periodic accounts to the court or supervisory authority if required by the court or by law. The mandate is subject to review and may be revoked or modified by the court if the mandatary fails to fulfill duties or if circumstances have changed such that the mandate is no longer in the mandator's best interests.

9. The mandate terminates upon:
    a. the mandator's death;
    b. the mandator's regaining of capacity, unless the mandate provides otherwise;
    c. revocation by the court.

10. Persons are encouraged to execute mandates in anticipation of incapacity as part of prudent planning for their future well-being and to preserve their autonomy and decision-making preferences.
