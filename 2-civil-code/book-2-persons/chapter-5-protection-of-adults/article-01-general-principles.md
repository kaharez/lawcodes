# Article 1 – General Principles

1. An adult of full age who, by reason of mental or physical illness, disability, weakening of faculties due to age, or other cause, is unable to care for their person or to administer their property, either temporarily or permanently, may be provided with a regime of protection in accordance with this Chapter.

2. All measures of protection must respect the dignity, autonomy, and fundamental rights of the protected person. The protected person retains all civil rights and capacity except to the extent that such rights are restricted by the protection regime.

3. Protection measures must be the least restrictive necessary to achieve their purposes. Preference shall be given to measures that support the person's decision-making and preserve their autonomy, rather than substituting the decision-making of a representative.

4. The protected person has the right to:
    (a) be informed of all measures concerning them and to be consulted to the extent possible;
    (b) receive appropriate services and support to maximize their independence and participation in decisions;
    (c) maintain personal relationships and participate in family and community life;
    (d) have their wishes, values, and preferences taken into account;
    (e) seek review and modification of protection measures.

5. Protection measures are subject to periodic review by the court or the competent authority to ensure they remain necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the protected person.
