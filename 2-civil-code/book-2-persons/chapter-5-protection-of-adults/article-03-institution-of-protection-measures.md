# Article 3 – Institution of Protection Measures

1. Protection measures may be instituted upon the application of:
    a. the person in need of protection;
    b. the spouse, partner, or close family members of the person;
    c. persons having an interest in the person's welfare;
    d. the public authority or official charged with protection of vulnerable persons;
    e. the court or competent authority on its own motion, where it has knowledge of the need for protection.

2. The application must be accompanied by:
    a. a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances demonstrating the need for protection;
    b. medical, psychiatric, or other expert evidence establishing the nature and extent of the person's incapacity;
    c. information concerning the person's family situation, living arrangements, property, and sources of income;
    d. a proposal as to the type of protection measure and the person to be appointed as curator, tutor, or advisor.

3. Upon receiving an application, the court or competent authority shall:
    a. order an assessment of the person's condition and capacity by qualified medical or psychiatric experts;
    b. conduct an interview with the person, unless this is impossible or would cause serious harm to the person;
    c. hear the views of family members, caregivers, and other interested persons;
    d. appoint legal counsel for the person if they do not have counsel and are unable to instruct counsel.

4. The person whose protection is sought has the right to:
    a. be informed of the application and the proposed measures;
    b. be present at the hearing and present evidence and arguments;
    c. be represented by legal counsel;
    d. contest the application and propose alternative measures.

5. The court or competent authority shall grant a protection measure only if satisfied by clear evidence that:
    a. the person is unable, by reason of incapacity, to care for themselves or administer their property;
    b. the proposed measure is necessary to protect the person's interests;
    c. less restrictive alternatives are inadequate;
    d. the proposed curator, tutor, or advisor is suitable and willing to serve.

6. The judgment or decree instituting protection shall specify:
    a. the nature and extent of the protection measure;
    b. the acts for which the protected person requires representation or assistance;
    c. the acts which the protected person may continue to perform independently;
    d. the identity of the curator, tutor, or advisor;
    e. the duration of the measure, if temporary, or the requirement for periodic review;
    f. any conditions or limitations on the powers of the curator, tutor, or advisor.

7. The judgment or decree must be registered and may be subject to appeal.
