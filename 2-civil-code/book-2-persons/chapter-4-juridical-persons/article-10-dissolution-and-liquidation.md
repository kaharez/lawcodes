# Article 10 – Dissolution and Liquidation

1. A juridical person may be dissolved:
    a. voluntarily, by decision of the general assembly or members in accordance with the constitutive documents;
    b. by expiry of the term specified in the constitutive documents, if applicable;
    c. upon accomplishment or impossibility of the purposes for which it was formed;
    d. judicially, upon application by interested parties, for serious mismanagement, illegal activities, deviation from purposes, or prolonged inactivity;
    e. by sovereign decree, for reasons of public interest or for violation of law;
    f. by insolvency, in accordance with insolvency law.

2. Dissolution does not immediately terminate the legal personality of the juridical person. The juridical person continues to exist for the purposes of liquidation until all assets are realized, debts are paid or provided for, and remaining assets are distributed.

3. Upon dissolution, the juridical person enters into liquidation. A liquidator is appointed:
    a. by the general assembly, if dissolution is voluntary;
    b. by the court, if dissolution is judicial or contentious;
    c. by the board of directors or the Chancellery, in other cases.

4. The liquidator is responsible for:
    a. taking custody of the assets of the juridical person;
    b. completing pending transactions and collecting debts;
    c. paying or making provision for the debts and obligations of the juridical person;
    d. distributing the remaining assets in accordance with the law and the constitutive documents;
    e. filing a final report and requesting cancellation of the registration.

5. Creditors have priority over members or shareholders in the distribution of assets. Debts must be paid in full, or adequate provision made, before any distribution to members.

6. After payment of debts, the remaining assets are distributed:
    a. in the case of a corporation for profit, to shareholders or members in accordance with their rights;
    b. in the case of a cooperative, in accordance with the cooperative's bylaws or, failing such provision, to other cooperatives, cooperative development funds, or charitable purposes;
    c. in the case of a non-profit association or foundation, to other entities pursuing similar purposes, in accordance with the constitutive documents or court order, and not for the private gain of members or directors.

7. Upon completion of liquidation, the liquidator files a final report with the registry and requests cancellation of the juridical person's registration. Upon cancellation, the juridical person ceases to exist.

8. Obligations incurred by directors, officers, or the liquidator in violation of law or in bad faith may result in personal liability.
