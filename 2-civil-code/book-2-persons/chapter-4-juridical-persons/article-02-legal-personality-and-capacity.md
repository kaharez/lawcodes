# Article 2 – Legal Personality and Capacity

1. Legal personality is acquired by a juridical person upon its registration with the appropriate authority or registry, or upon such other act or formality as is required by law or sovereign decree for its particular legal form.

2. The legal personality of a juridical person is separate and distinct from that of its members, shareholders, directors, or founders. Acts performed by or on behalf of the juridical person bind the juridical person and not its members personally, save where the law provides otherwise.

3. A juridical person continues in existence until it is dissolved in accordance with law, its constitutive documents, or sovereign decree. Dissolution does not immediately extinguish legal personality; the juridical person continues to exist for the purposes of liquidation until all assets are distributed and all obligations are satisfied or provided for.

4. A juridical person acts through its organs, officers, directors, and authorized representatives in accordance with its constitutive documents and the law governing its form. Acts performed by authorized representatives within the scope of their authority bind the juridical person.

5. The capacity of a juridical person is limited by:
    (a) the purposes set forth in its constitutive documents;
    (b) the nature of its legal form and the rules governing that form;
    (c) prohibitions imposed by law or public order.

6. Acts performed by a juridical person beyond its purposes or capacity (ultra vires acts) may be challenged by members, directors, or interested third parties, but do not automatically render such acts void as against third parties acting in good faith.
