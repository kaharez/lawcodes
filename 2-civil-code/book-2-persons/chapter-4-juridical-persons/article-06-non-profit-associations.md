# Article 6 – Non-Profit Associations

1. A non-profit association is a juridical person formed by a group of persons who associate for purposes other than the pursuit of profit, including cultural, educational, social, charitable, recreational, professional, or other lawful purposes serving the common interest of its members or the public benefit.

2. Non-profit associations are prohibited from distributing profits, surplus, or assets to members, directors, or founders during the existence of the association or upon its dissolution, except as reasonable compensation for services rendered or expenses incurred.

3. A non-profit association is formed by the execution of constitutive documents, which shall state:
    a. the name and domicile of the association;
    b. the purposes and objects, which must be specific and lawful;
    c. the conditions and procedures for admission, suspension, and expulsion of members;
    d. the rights and obligations of members;
    e. the governance structure, including the general assembly of members and the board of directors or executive committee;
    f. the procedures for amending the constitutive documents;
    g. the procedures for dissolution and distribution of assets upon dissolution.

4. The constitutive documents must be registered with the appropriate authority or registry. Upon registration, the association acquires legal personality.

5. All members of a non-profit association have equal voting rights in the general assembly, unless the constitutive documents provide for different classes of membership with specified voting rights, provided that such distinctions are reasonable and do not undermine the democratic character of the association.

6. The association is governed by a general assembly of members, which is the supreme decision-making body, and by a board of directors or executive committee elected by the general assembly to manage the day-to-day affairs of the association.

7. Non-profit associations that pursue purposes of public benefit or charitable purposes may be granted special status conferring tax exemptions, eligibility for public grants or subsidies, and other benefits, upon application to and approval by the competent authority.

8. A non-profit association may be dissolved voluntarily by decision of the general assembly, judicially for violation of law or its purposes, or by sovereign decree. Upon dissolution, assets shall be distributed in accordance with the constitutive documents or, failing such provision, to other non-profit entities pursuing similar purposes, and in no case to members for private gain.
