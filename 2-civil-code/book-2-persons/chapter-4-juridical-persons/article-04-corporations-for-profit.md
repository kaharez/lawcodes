# Article 4 – Corporations for Profit

1. A corporation for profit is a juridical person organized for the purpose of carrying on business or commercial activities and distributing profits to its shareholders or members.

2. Corporations for profit are governed by the provisions of this Code, by special legislation or decree regulating corporations and commercial entities, and by their articles of incorporation and bylaws.

3. A corporation for profit is formed by the execution and registration of articles of incorporation, which shall state:
    (a) the name of the corporation;
    (b) the purposes and objects of the corporation;
    (c) the registered office and domicile;
    (d) the capital structure, including authorized share capital and classes of shares, if applicable;
    (e) the names and addresses of the initial directors or governing board;
    (f) such other particulars as are required by law or decree.

4. The articles of incorporation must be registered with the appropriate authority or registry designated by law or decree. Upon registration, the corporation acquires legal personality.

5. The liability of shareholders or members for the debts and obligations of the corporation is limited to the amount of their capital contribution or subscription, unless the law or the articles of incorporation provide otherwise.

6. The corporation is managed by a board of directors or governing body elected by the shareholders or members in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws. Directors owe fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the corporation and must act in its best interests.

7. Profits may be distributed to shareholders or members in the form of dividends or distributions in accordance with the capital structure and the decisions of the board of directors or shareholders, after satisfaction of the corporation's obligations and maintenance of required reserves.

8. Detailed rules governing the formation, governance, operation, and dissolution of corporations for profit shall be established by special legislation, decree, or regulations issued by the competent authority.
