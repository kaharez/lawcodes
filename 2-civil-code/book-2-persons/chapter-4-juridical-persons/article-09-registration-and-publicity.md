# Article 9 – Registration and Publicity

1. All juridical persons must be registered in a public registry maintained by the authority or office designated by law or sovereign decree.

2. The registry shall contain:
    a. the name and legal form of the juridical person;
    b. the domicile and registered office;
    c. the purposes and objects;
    d. the names and addresses of directors, officers, or trustees;
    e. the date of formation and registration;
    f. such other information as is required by law or decree.

3. The constitutive documents of the juridical person, including articles of incorporation, statutes, bylaws, and foundation charters, must be filed with the registry and made available for public inspection.

4. Amendments to the constitutive documents, changes of directors or registered office, and other material changes must be registered within a reasonable time after their occurrence. Failure to register such changes does not affect the internal validity of the changes but may render them inoperable as against third parties acting in good faith.

5. The registry is public, and any person may inspect the registered information and obtain certified copies of documents upon payment of the prescribed fees.

6. Juridical persons are required to display their full legal name, registration number, and registered office on all official documents, correspondence, contracts, and publications.

7. False or misleading information provided to the registry, or failure to register required information, may result in administrative sanctions, fines, suspension of the juridical person's activities, or judicial dissolution, in addition to any criminal liability for fraud or misrepresentation.
