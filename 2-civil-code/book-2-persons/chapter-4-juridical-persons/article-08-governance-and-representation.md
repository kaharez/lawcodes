# Article 8 – Governance and Representation

1. A juridical person acts through its organs, officers, directors, and authorized representatives in accordance with its constitutive documents, bylaws, and the law governing its legal form.

2. The principal organs of a juridical person typically include:
    a. the general assembly or meeting of members or shareholders, which is the supreme decision-making body;
    b. the board of directors, governing board, or executive committee, which manages the affairs of the juridical person;
    c. such other organs, officers, or committees as are established by the constitutive documents or bylaws.

3. The board of directors or governing body is responsible for:
    a. managing the property and affairs of the juridical person;
    b. implementing the decisions of the general assembly;
    c. ensuring compliance with the law and the constitutive documents;
    d. appointing officers and managers;
    e. preparing financial statements and reports.

4. Directors, officers, and managers of a juridical person owe fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and diligence. They must act in good faith, in the best interests of the juridical person, and in accordance with its purposes. They must avoid conflicts of interest and refrain from using their position for personal gain at the expense of the juridical person.

5. Directors, officers, and managers may be held personally liable for damage caused to the juridical person, its members, creditors, or third parties by their willful misconduct, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, or violation of law or the constitutive documents.

6. The juridical person is bound by acts performed on its behalf by persons with actual or apparent authority to represent it. Authority may be conferred by the constitutive documents, bylaws, resolution of the board or general assembly, or by law.

7. Third parties dealing with representatives of a juridical person in good faith are protected, and the juridical person may not invoke internal limitations on authority of which the third party was unaware, unless such limitations are required by law to be publicly registered or are obviously apparent from the circumstances.

8. The general assembly has the ultimate authority to amend the constitutive documents, elect or remove directors, approve major transactions, decide on dissolution, and exercise such other powers as are reserved to it by law or the constitutive documents. Decisions of the general assembly are made by vote of the members or shareholders in accordance with the procedures specified in the constitutive documents.
