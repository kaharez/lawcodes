# Article 5 – Cooperative Corporations

1. A cooperative corporation is a juridical person organized and operated on cooperative principles for the mutual benefit of its members, whether for economic, social, cultural, or other lawful purposes.

2. Cooperative corporations are governed by cooperative principles including:
    a. voluntary and open membership;
    b. democratic control by members, with each member having one vote regardless of capital contribution or share ownership;
    c. economic participation by members through contributions and equitable distribution of surplus;
    d. autonomy and independence;
    e. education, training, and information for members;
    f. cooperation among cooperatives;
    g. concern for community and sustainable development.

3. Types of cooperative corporations include:
    a. worker cooperatives, owned and democratically controlled by worker-members;
    b. consumer cooperatives, owned by consumer-members;
    c. producer cooperatives, owned by producers who market products collectively;
    d. housing cooperatives, as further provided in Book III;
    e. credit unions and financial cooperatives;
    f. multi-stakeholder cooperatives, involving multiple classes of members.

4. Cooperative corporations are formed by the execution and registration of constitutive documents, which shall include:
    a. the name and domicile of the cooperative;
    b. the purposes and objects;
    c. the rights and obligations of members;
    d. the capital structure and distribution of surplus;
    e. the governance structure and voting procedures;
    f. procedures for admission, withdrawal, and expulsion of members.

5. Membership in a cooperative is personal and non-transferable, except as provided in the cooperative's bylaws. Members participate in governance through general meetings in which each member has one vote.

6. Surplus generated by a cooperative may be:
    a. allocated to reserves as required by law or the cooperative's bylaws;
    b. distributed to members in proportion to their use of the cooperative's services (patronage refunds) or in proportion to their labour contribution in the case of worker cooperatives;
    c. allocated to cooperative education, development, or community purposes;
    d. returned to the cooperative for reinvestment.

7. Upon dissolution of a cooperative, after payment of debts and return of capital contributions to members, any remaining assets shall be distributed in accordance with the cooperative's bylaws or, failing such provision, to other cooperatives, cooperative development funds, or charitable purposes, and shall not be distributed to members as private gain.

8. Cooperative corporations benefit from favourable legal treatment, including simplified incorporation procedures, tax exemptions or reductions, preferential access to public procurement and financing, and technical assistance, as provided by law or decree.
