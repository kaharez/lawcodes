# Article 7 – Foundations

1. A foundation is a juridical person created by the dedication of property by a natural or juridical person (the founder) to a specific purpose of public benefit, charitable, educational, cultural, scientific, or religious nature, without having members.

2. A foundation is established by:
    (a) inter vivos act, through a notarial deed or other solemn instrument dedicating property to the foundation and specifying its purposes and governance; or
    (b) testamentary disposition, through a will dedicating property to be transferred to the foundation upon the founder's death.

3. The foundation charter or constitutive document shall specify:
    (a) the name and domicile of the foundation;
    (b) the purposes of the foundation, which must be specific, lawful, and of public or charitable benefit;
    (c) the initial endowment and property dedicated to the foundation;
    (d) the governance structure, including the board of directors, trustees, or administrators;
    (e) the procedures for appointing and removing directors or trustees;
    (f) the rules governing the management and use of the foundation's assets;
    (g) provisions for amendment of the foundation charter, if permitted;
    (h) provisions for dissolution and distribution of assets upon dissolution.

4. A foundation must be approved by the Sovereign or the competent authority designated by decree before acquiring legal personality. Approval shall be granted if the foundation's purposes are lawful and serve the public or charitable benefit, and if the endowment is sufficient to accomplish those purposes.

5. The foundation is governed by a board of directors or trustees, who hold the property in trust for the purposes of the foundation and administer it in accordance with the foundation charter and the law.

6. Directors or trustees owe fiduciary duties to the foundation and must act in accordance with the founder's intent as expressed in the foundation charter. They must prudently manage the foundation's assets, preserve the endowment, and use the income and, where appropriate, the capital for the designated purposes.

7. The purposes of a foundation are generally irrevocable and may not be altered, except:
    (a) as provided in the foundation charter, within the limits permitted by law;
    (b) by judicial order or sovereign decree, where the original purposes have become impossible or impractical to achieve, in which case the purposes may be modified to purposes as near as possible to the founder's original intent (cy-près doctrine).

8. A foundation is subject to supervision by a public authority or designated official to ensure compliance with its purposes, proper management of assets, and adherence to the foundation charter and the law. The supervisory authority may require periodic reports, conduct audits, and intervene to correct mismanagement or deviations from the foundation's purposes.

9. A foundation may be dissolved:
    (a) upon expiry of the term specified in the foundation charter, if applicable;
    (b) when the purposes of the foundation have been fully accomplished or have become impossible to achieve;
    (c) by judicial order or sovereign decree for serious mismanagement, deviation from purposes, or violation of law.

10. Upon dissolution, the assets of the foundation shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the foundation charter or, failing such provision, to other foundations or charitable entities pursuing similar purposes, as determined by the court or the supervisory authority. Assets shall not be distributed for private gain.
