# Article 10 – Domicile and Residence

1. Every person has a domicile, which is the place where they have their principal establishment and to which, whenever they are absent, they intend to return. Domicile determines a person's personal law for purposes of civil status, family relations, and succession, and establishes jurisdiction for legal proceedings.

2. A person can have only one domicile at any given time, although they may have multiple residences.

3. Domicile of origin is the domicile a person has at birth, which is:
    a. for a legitimate child, the domicile of the parents or, if the parents have separate domiciles, the domicile of the parent with whom the child resides;
    b. for a child born out of wedlock, the domicile of the parent who has custody or with whom the child resides;
    c. for a foundling or a child whose parents are unknown, the place where the child is found.

4. A person may acquire a domicile of choice by establishing their principal residence in a new place with the intention of remaining there permanently or indefinitely. Domicile of choice replaces domicile of origin.

5. Intention to establish domicile may be inferred from the circumstances, including:
    a. the length and continuity of residence;
    b. the location of the person's family, work, business, and social ties;
    c. declarations of intention or conduct indicating permanence;
    d. abandonment of the former domicile.

6. Domicile is not lost by temporary absence or travel, provided the person retains the intention to return.

7. Special rules apply to the domicile of:
    a. Minors: A minor's domicile is that of their parents or legal guardian. An emancipated minor may establish their own domicile.
    b. Persons under protection: The domicile of a person under curatorship or tutorship is that determined by the curator or tutor, subject to court approval.
    c. Married persons and partners: Each spouse or partner may have their own domicile, or they may establish a common domicile by mutual consent.
    d. Kaharagian nationals abroad: Kaharagian nationals who reside abroad may declare Kaharagia as their domicile for purposes of personal law, civil status, and succession, even in the absence of territory, provided they maintain a genuine and effective connection to the Kaharagian community.

8. Residence is the place where a person actually lives, whether permanently or temporarily. A person may have multiple residences. Habitual residence is the place where a person has lived for a substantial period and established the centre of their life and activities.

9. In the absence of domicile or when domicile cannot be determined, a person's residence or, failing that, their place of actual presence, shall be used for purposes of jurisdiction and applicable law.

10. Juridical persons have their domicile at their registered office, as provided in Chapter IV of this Book.
