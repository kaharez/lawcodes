# Article 7 – Declaration of Absence

1. A person may be declared absent if their whereabouts have been unknown for a continuous period of at least one year and diligent inquiries have failed to locate them or establish whether they are living or dead.

2. A declaration of absence may be sought by:
    a. the spouse, partner, or close family members of the absent person;
    b. persons having a legal or pecuniary interest in the absent person's affairs;
    c. the public authority or the competent official;
    d. the court on its own motion where protection of the absent person's interests requires.

3. Before declaring absence, the court or competent authority must:
    a. order publication of notice in official gazettes and such other media as may reach the absent person or persons who may have knowledge of their whereabouts;
    b. conduct an inquiry to locate the absent person or ascertain their fate;
    c. hear evidence from family members, friends, and other persons who may have information.

4. Upon declaring a person absent, the court shall appoint a curator or administrator to provisionally manage the absent person's property and affairs, with powers to:
    a. preserve the property and collect income;
    b. pay debts, taxes, and necessary expenses;
    c. continue the absent person's business or lease property if necessary to preserve its value;
    d. provide for the support of the absent person's spouse, partner, dependents, and family members from the property, to the extent reasonable and in accordance with the person's prior practice.

5. The curator or administrator must act prudently and in the best interests of the absent person, on the presumption that the person is alive and may return. Major transactions, including sale of immovable property or business assets, require court authorization and may be permitted only if necessary to preserve the property or provide for dependents.

6. The absent person's spouse or partner may petition the court for dissolution of the marriage or termination of the partnership on grounds of absence, in accordance with the provisions of family law.

7. If the absent person returns or is found to be alive, the declaration of absence is revoked, and the person resumes control of their property and affairs, subject to accounting by the curator and ratification of necessary acts performed during the absence.
