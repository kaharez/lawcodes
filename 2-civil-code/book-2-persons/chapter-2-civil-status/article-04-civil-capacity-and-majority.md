# Article 4 – Civil Capacity and Majority

1. Majority is attained upon completion of the eighteenth year of age.
2. A person who has not attained majority is considered a minor and is subject to the authority of their parent(s) or legal guardian for civil acts, unless emancipated.
3. Emancipation may occur:
    (a) By marriage, where marriage is lawfully authorised for a person below the age of majority; such marriage shall confer full civil capacity upon the minor spouse from the date of the marriage; or
    (b) By sovereign decree, granted upon petition to the Royal Chancellery and, where appropriate, following inquiry or adjudication in accordance with procedures determined by the Sovereign.
4. Acts performed by minors without proper representation or authorisation shall be voidable, unless subsequently confirmed by decree or by the person upon attaining majority.
