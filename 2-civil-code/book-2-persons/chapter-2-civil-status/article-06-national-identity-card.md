# Article 6 – National Identity Card

1. Every Kaharagian national who has attained the age of eighteen years shall be required to hold a valid National Identity Card issued by the state.
2. The National Identity Card shall serve as official proof of nationality and civil status and shall be used for all public acts, registrations, and official transactions conducted in the name of the state.
3. Nationals residing outside the territory of the state shall not be subject to penalties for failure to maintain an updated card; however, they shall be required to obtain or renew the card prior to exercising rights or benefits conferred by nationality, or upon resuming residence within the state.
4. Renewal of the National Identity Card shall be required:
    a. Upon expiration of its validity period as determined by regulation;
    b. Upon change of name, civil status, or other essential identifying particulars; or
    c. Upon significant alteration of appearance rendering previous identification unreliable.
5. Applications for issuance, renewal, or replacement of the National Identity Card shall be recorded both in the National Register of Kaharagian Nationals and in the internal Registry of Kaharagian Identity Cards. The Registry of Identity Cards shall be maintained by the competent authority solely for administrative and verification purposes and shall not constitute a public register.
6. Transitional provisions, including initial issuance to all existing nationals, shall be determined by sovereign decree and published in the Royal Kaharagian Gazette.
