# Article 8 – Presumption of Death

1. A person may be declared presumed dead if:
    (a) their whereabouts have been unknown for a continuous period of at least seven years, despite diligent efforts to locate them, and there is no reliable evidence that they are alive; or
    (b) they disappeared in circumstances involving a serious and imminent threat to life, such as shipwreck, aircraft disaster, earthquake, war, or other catastrophic event, and a reasonable period has elapsed (not less than one year from the event) without any news of their survival.

2. A declaration of presumed death may be sought by:
    (a) the spouse, partner, or close family members;
    (b) persons having a legal interest in the person's estate or succession;
    (c) the curator or administrator of the absent person's property;
    (d) the public authority or competent official.

3. The court shall declare a person presumed dead only after:
    (a) conducting an inquiry into the circumstances of the disappearance and the efforts made to locate the person;
    (b) publishing notice and allowing a period for any person having knowledge of the missing person to come forward;
    (c) satisfying itself that there is no reasonable prospect of the person being found alive.

4. The judgment declaring presumed death shall specify the date of death, which shall be:
    (a) in the case of disappearance in a catastrophic event, the date of the event or the last date on which the person was known to be alive;
    (b) in the case of prolonged absence, the date fixed by the court based on the circumstances, or the last date on which the person was reliably known to be alive.

5. Upon declaration of presumed death:
    (a) the person is considered deceased for all legal purposes, including succession, dissolution of marriage or partnership, and distribution of property;
    (b) the person's succession is opened and their estate may be administered and distributed in accordance with succession law;
    (c) the person's spouse or partner is free to remarry or enter into a new partnership;
    (d) any rights or benefits dependent on the person's life are extinguished, and obligations are settled.

6. The declaration of presumed death must be registered in the civil register, indicating the date and circumstances of the presumed death.
