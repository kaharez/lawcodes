# Article 9 – Return of Person Declared Presumed Dead

1. If a person who has been declared presumed dead returns or is discovered to be alive, they or any interested person may petition the court for annulment of the declaration of presumed death.

2. Upon proof that the person is alive, the court shall annul the declaration of presumed death. The person regains their civil status and legal personality, and the registration of death is cancelled.

3. Property that remains in the hands of heirs or other persons who received it from the estate shall be returned to the person, subject to the following rules:
    (a) Immovable property and movable property still in existence shall be returned in its current state.
    (b) If property has been sold or otherwise alienated by heirs or beneficiaries acting in good faith, the person is entitled to the proceeds of sale or the value of the property at the time of alienation.
    (c) If property has been consumed or dissipated by heirs acting in good faith, there is no obligation to restore it or pay compensation, unless the heir has been enriched thereby.
    (d) Heirs or beneficiaries who acted in bad faith, knowing or having reason to believe the person was alive, must return the property, pay the value of property consumed, and compensate the person for any loss.

4. Third parties who acquired property from heirs or beneficiaries in good faith and for value are protected, and the property need not be returned to the person declared presumed dead. The person may have a claim against the heir or beneficiary who alienated the property.

5. If the person's spouse or partner has remarried or entered into a new partnership in good faith following the declaration of presumed death:
    (a) the subsequent marriage or partnership is valid and continues in effect;
    (b) the prior marriage or partnership is considered to have been dissolved by the presumed death and is not automatically revived;
    (c) the person may not reclaim rights as spouse or partner, but may have claims for support or property division in accordance with family law.

6. If the spouse or partner has not remarried or entered into a new partnership, the marriage or partnership may be revived by mutual consent and registration, or either party may seek dissolution if they no longer wish to continue the relationship.

7. Rights and benefits that were extinguished by the presumed death are not automatically restored. The person may need to reapply or seek reinstatement in accordance with the relevant law or administrative procedures.

8. Any legal acts or transactions performed by the person during the period they were declared dead are valid, despite the declaration, if they prove their identity and the acts are otherwise lawful.
