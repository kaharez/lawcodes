# Article 2 – Correction and Amendment of Records

1. Errors or omissions in the civil registers may be corrected by order of the Royal Chancellery or by sovereign decree.

2. Amendments to civil status, including name changes, recognition of parentage, or rectification of dates or places, shall require supporting documentation and, where necessary, a decree.

3. All corrections and amendments shall be made by annotation to the existing record; erasure or deletion of original entries is prohibited to preserve the integrity of the registers.
