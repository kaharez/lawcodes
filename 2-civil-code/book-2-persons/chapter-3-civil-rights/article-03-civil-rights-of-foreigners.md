# Article 3 – Civil Rights of Foreigners

1. Foreign persons lawfully recognised by the state shall enjoy civil rights within Kaharagia to the extent provided by law or sovereign decree.
2. Such rights include recognition of contracts, protection of personal dignity and family status, and access to the civil registers for matters in which they are directly concerned.
3. Foreigners may not claim rights exclusive to Kaharagian nationals, including but not limited to national honours, participation in sovereign institutions, and privileges tied to nationality, unless expressly authorised by decree. However, foreigners may petition for registration or grant of heraldic arms in accordance with the laws and traditions of the state.
