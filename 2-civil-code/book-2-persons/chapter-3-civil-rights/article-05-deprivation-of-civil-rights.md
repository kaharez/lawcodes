# Article 5 – Deprivation of Civil Rights

1. Certain civil rights, including but not limited to the right to bear heraldic arms, to receive or retain national honours, and to participate in national institutions, may be withdrawn from an individual by sovereign decree.
2. Grounds for deprivation include:
    (a) dishonourable conduct or acts gravely incompatible with allegiance to the state;
    (b) misuse, falsification, or unauthorised assumption of names, titles, or heraldic arms;
    (c) treason, rebellion, or armed hostility against the Sovereign or the state;
    (d) conviction of serious criminal offences which, in the judgment of the Sovereign, warrant deprivation in addition to any sentence imposed.

3. Deprivation of civil rights is a distinct measure from loss of nationality under the Criminal Code, Book I, Chapter 6, Article 5:
    (a) Deprivation of civil rights removes specific privileges (honours, heraldic arms, participation in institutions) but does not terminate nationality or nationality status;
    (b) Loss of nationality terminates all nationality rights and automatically effects deprivation of all civil rights and honours;
    (c) Deprivation may be applied where loss of nationality is not warranted or where the person is not a national;
    (d) Both measures may not be applied for the same conduct; where nationality is lost, separate deprivation is unnecessary.

4. The decree of deprivation shall specify whether the withdrawal is temporary or permanent, and shall also provide for any conditions of restoration.
5. The decree shall be published in the Royal Kaharagian Gazette unless the Sovereign determines, for reasons of state or personal dignity, that publication shall be withheld; in all cases, the decree shall be recorded in the registers maintained by the Chancellery.

6. Restoration of deprived rights may be granted by sovereign decree upon petition or by the Sovereign's own motion.
