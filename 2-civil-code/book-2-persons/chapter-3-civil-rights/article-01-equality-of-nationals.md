# Article 1 – Equality of Nationals

1. All nationals of the state are equal before the laws of Kaharagia and enjoy the same civil rights and obligations, without distinction of origin, sex, birth, or noble status.
2. Nobility and heraldic titles confer honours and precedence but do not grant or diminish civil capacity or equality before the law.
3. Distinctions in civil rights may be made only by law or sovereign decree and shall be founded on legitimate public or ceremonial purposes.
