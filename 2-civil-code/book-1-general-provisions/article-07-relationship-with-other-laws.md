# Article 7 – Relationship with Other Laws

1. This Civil Code does not derogate from the reserved matters of the Royal House, which remain governed exclusively by dynastic law.

2. This Code does not affect the Sovereign prerogatives enumerated in the Fundamental Principles.

3. Where matters of criminal law intersect with civil obligations, the provisions of the Criminal Code shall determine criminal responsibility, while this Code governs civil consequences.

4. Special legislation on specific subjects supplements but does not replace this Code unless expressly provided.

5. International treaties duly ratified and published prevail over domestic civil law to the extent of any inconsistency.
