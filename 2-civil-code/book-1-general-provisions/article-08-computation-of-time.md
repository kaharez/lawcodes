   (a) a period expressed in days shall run from midnight to midnight;
   (b) the day on which the period begins to run is not counted;
   (c) the period expires at midnight on the last day.

2. If the last day falls on a non-business day, the period is extended to the next business day.

3. Periods expressed in months or years are computed:
   (a) from the same day of the month or year;
   (b) if no corresponding day exists, until the last day of the month.

4. References to "working days" exclude weekends and official public holidays.
