# Article 1 – Acceptance and Renunciation

1. No person is compelled to accept a succession. Every heir and legatee has the right to accept or renounce.

2. Acceptance may be:
    a. express, by declaration in writing;
    b. tacit, by conduct manifesting the intention to accept, such as taking possession of estate property or performing acts that only an heir would have the right to do.

3. Acceptance may be:
    a. pure and simple, making the heir liable for all debts and obligations of the deceased without limit;
    b. under benefit of inventory, limiting the heir's liability to the value of the assets inherited.

4. An heir who accepts under benefit of inventory is not personally liable for debts of the estate exceeding the value of the assets. The heir must prepare an inventory of the estate and administer it separately from their own property.

5. An heir who conceals assets of the estate, makes a fraudulent inventory, or fails to include known creditors forfeits the benefit of inventory and becomes liable without limit.

6. Renunciation must be express and made by written declaration filed with the competent registry. Renunciation is irrevocable except in cases of fraud or duress.

7. An heir who renounces is deemed never to have been an heir. Their share accrues to the other heirs of the same degree or, failing that, to heirs of the next degree.

8. Renunciation may be set aside at the instance of creditors of the heir if made to their prejudice, allowing them to accept the succession on behalf of the heir to the extent necessary to satisfy their claims.

9. The right to accept or renounce prescribes after ten years from the opening of succession. If the heir dies before exercising the right, it passes to their own heirs.

10. Creditors of the estate may require an heir to elect between acceptance and renunciation within a specified period, failing which the heir is deemed to have renounced.
