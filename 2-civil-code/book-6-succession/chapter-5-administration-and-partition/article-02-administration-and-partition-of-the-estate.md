# Article 2 – Administration and Partition of the Estate

1. From the opening of succession until partition, the estate is held in indivision by all heirs and legatees.

2. During indivision, the estate is administered by all heirs jointly or by an administrator appointed by agreement or judicial decree.

3. The administrator must manage the estate as a prudent administrator, preserve the assets, pay debts and charges, and render accounts to the heirs.

4. No heir may be compelled to remain in indivision. Any heir may demand partition at any time, unless partition has been excluded by the testator for a specified period not exceeding ten years.

5. Partition may be effected:
    a. by agreement of all heirs, in accordance with the rules of partition of co-ownership;
    b. by judicial decree, upon petition of one or more heirs.

6. Before partition, debts and obligations of the deceased must be paid or secured. Creditors of the estate have priority over heirs and legatees.

7. Each heir is entitled to a share corresponding to their fraction of the estate. Partition allocates specific assets to each heir in satisfaction of their share.

8. Where assets cannot be divided in kind without diminution of value, they are sold and the proceeds distributed among the heirs. Alternatively, an heir may retain an asset by compensating the other heirs in money.

9. Heirs owe each other mutual warranties against eviction and hidden defects in the property allotted to them upon partition.

10. Partition may be rescinded for lesion (gross inadequacy) if an heir receives less than half of what they were entitled to, provided the action is brought within two years of partition.

11. An executor designated by the testator has the duty to ensure execution of the testament, pay debts, deliver legacies, and perform other acts necessary to give effect to the testator's will.

12. The executor has the powers conferred by the testament or, in the absence of specification, the powers necessary to carry out their duties. The executor must render accounts to the heirs and may be removed for breach of duty.

13. Unless otherwise provided by the testament, the office of executor terminates one year after acceptance, or upon completion of the duties if sooner.
