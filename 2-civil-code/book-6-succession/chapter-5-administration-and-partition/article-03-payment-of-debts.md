# Article 3 – Payment of Debts

1. Heirs are liable for the debts and charges of the deceased to the extent of the value of the assets inherited, provided they have accepted the succession under benefit of inventory or with limitation of liability.

2. An heir who accepts the succession purely and simply is personally liable for all debts of the deceased, without limitation, even if the debts exceed the value of the assets inherited.

3. Debts of the estate include:
    (a) all obligations of the deceased existing at the time of death, whether due or not yet due, liquidated or unliquidated;
    (b) charges and expenses of the succession, including funeral expenses, costs of administration, and fees of executors;
    (c) legacies and testamentary charges;
    (d) taxes and duties imposed by law on the succession.

4. Before partition, creditors of the estate must be paid or secured. Heirs may not distribute the estate or take possession of their shares until debts have been satisfied, except with the consent of creditors or judicial authorization.

5. Creditors of the deceased have a right of action against all heirs jointly and severally for payment of debts from the estate assets. Each heir is liable in proportion to their share of the estate.

6. Where an heir pays more than their proportionate share of the debts, they have a right of recourse against the other heirs for contribution in proportion to their shares.

7. The following debts and charges have priority and are paid in the following order:
    (a) funeral expenses, up to a reasonable amount appropriate to the station of the deceased;
    (b) expenses of administration and preservation of the estate;
    (c) expenses of the last illness of the deceased;
    (d) wages and salaries of employees of the deceased for the last six months;
    (e) secured debts, up to the value of the secured property;
    (f) unsecured debts, pro rata if the estate is insufficient;
    (g) legacies and testamentary charges, to the extent assets remain after payment of debts.

8. Creditors of the deceased have priority over creditors of individual heirs. Property of the estate may not be attached or seized by creditors of an heir until partition has been effected and the heir's share has been attributed.

9. A creditor who was unaware of the death and did not present their claim before partition may pursue heirs individually for payment of the debt, to the extent of the value of assets each received, but may not set aside the partition.

10. Heirs are not liable for debts of which they had no knowledge and which were not disclosed by the deceased, except to the extent of assets actually received. A creditor who failed to present their claim within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the death may forfeit priority.

11. Contingent, disputed, or unliquidated debts are provided for by retention of a sufficient reserve or by provision of security. If the debt later proves unfounded, the reserve is distributed among the heirs.

12. Where the estate is insolvent, heirs must seek judicial declaration of insolvency and supervision of the liquidation. Creditors rank according to their priority, and any deficit is borne by unsecured creditors pro rata.
