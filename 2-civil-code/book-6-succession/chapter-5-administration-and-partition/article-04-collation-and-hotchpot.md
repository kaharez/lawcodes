# Article 4 – Collation and Hotchpot

1. Collation is the bringing into account of gifts made by the deceased to an heir during the deceased's lifetime, for purposes of calculating the heir's share of the succession.

2. Descendants who succeed, whether by their own right or by representation, must bring into collation all gifts received from the deceased during their lifetime, unless the deceased expressly dispensed with collation.

3. Collation is not required:
    (a) where the deceased expressly declared the gift to be made in advancement of the heir's share or expressly dispensed with collation;
    (b) for gifts made to ascendants, collateral relatives, or the surviving spouse, unless they were expressly stated to be subject to collation;
    (c) for ordinary gifts of modest value appropriate to the circumstances (customary presents);
    (d) for expenses of education, maintenance, or establishment in trade or profession, unless disproportionate to the deceased's means.

4. An heir may avoid collation by renouncing the succession. Renunciation relieves the heir of the obligation to bring gifts into account but also deprives them of any share in the succession.

5. Collation may be made:
    (a) in kind, by returning the property received to the estate, if the property still exists in substantially the same condition;
    (b) by taking less, whereby the value of the gift is deducted from the heir's share;
    (c) in value, by paying into the estate an amount equal to the value of the gift at the time it was made, adjusted for inflation or other factors as the court may direct.

6. The value of collatable gifts is determined as of the date of the gift, but account may be taken of subsequent changes in value due to improvements, deterioration, or inflation, according to principles of equity.

7. If the value of gifts received by an heir exceeds their share of the succession, the heir is not required to refund the excess, but receives nothing further from the succession. Other heirs divide the estate equally among themselves.

8. An heir who has sold or consumed the gifted property is deemed to have received its value and must bring that value into collation, unless the property was consumed in the ordinary course of life or business and without intent to defeat collation.

9. Gifts made to a descendant who does not succeed (because they predeceased or renounced) need not be collated, but the descendants representing that person must bring into collation gifts made to the person they represent.

10. Testamentary dispositions (legacies) are not subject to collation, but are charged against the disponible portion of the estate. If legacies exceed the disponible portion, they are subject to reduction in favour of forced heirs.

11. Where the deceased made gifts to multiple heirs, each brings their gifts into collation separately. The total value of collatable gifts is added to the net estate to determine the total mass available for distribution.

12. After collation, each heir receives a share proportional to their entitlement, reduced by the value of gifts already received. If an heir has received more than their share, other heirs receive larger portions to restore equality.
