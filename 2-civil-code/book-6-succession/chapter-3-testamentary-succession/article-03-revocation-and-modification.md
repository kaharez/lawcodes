# Article 3 – Revocation and Modification

1. A testament is revocable at any time during the testator's life. No testament or clause thereof may be made irrevocable, and any provision purporting to restrict the testator's power of revocation is null and void.

2. A testament may be revoked:
    (a) expressly, by executing a new testament declaring revocation of the prior testament;
    (b) tacitly, by executing a new testament containing dispositions incompatible with the prior testament;
    (c) by physical destruction, cancellation, or obliteration of the testament by the testator with the intention to revoke.

3. Express revocation may be total, revoking the entire prior testament, or partial, revoking only specified dispositions or clauses. If partial, the remainder of the prior testament remains in effect.

4. A later testament revokes a prior testament to the extent of any inconsistency or incompatibility. If the later testament does not dispose of the entire estate, the prior testament remains effective as to the undisposed portion, unless revocation was express and total.

5. Revocation by physical destruction requires:
    (a) an act by the testator or by another person in the testator's presence and at the testator's direction;
    (b) destruction, tearing, burning, cancellation, or obliteration of the testament or of its essential parts;
    (c) intention to revoke, manifested by the circumstances of the act.

6. If a testament is accidentally destroyed, mutilated, or lost without the testator's intention to revoke, it may be proved by secondary evidence and given effect if its contents are established with reasonable certainty.

7. Revocation of a testament does not revive a prior testament previously revoked, unless the testator expressly provides for revival or executes a new testament confirming the prior testament.

8. A disposition in favour of a spouse or partner is automatically revoked by:
    (a) divorce or dissolution of the partnership, pronounced during the testator's life;
    (b) judicial separation with cessation of cohabitation;
    (c) subsequent marriage or partnership with another person, unless the testament expressly provides otherwise.

9. A disposition in favour of a person who later becomes unworthy is not automatically revoked but is ineffective from the date of the act giving rise to unworthiness, unless the testator forgives the unworthy person by subsequent instrument.

10. Modifications to a testament must comply with the same formalities as execution of a testament. Informal additions, marginalia, or corrections made by the testator after execution are not effective unless they comply with the requirements for a holographic testament.

11. Where a testament has been revoked and the testator subsequently wishes to reinstate it, the testator must execute a new testament confirming the dispositions or declaring revival of the revoked testament.

12. A codicil is a testamentary instrument modifying or supplementing a prior testament without revoking it entirely. A codicil must comply with the formalities required for testaments and is interpreted together with the testament it modifies.
