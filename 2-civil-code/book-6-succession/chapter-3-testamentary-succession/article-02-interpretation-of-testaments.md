# Article 2 – Interpretation of Testaments

1. Testaments are to be interpreted according to the intention of the testator, ascertained from the words used, the context, the circumstances surrounding execution, and the testator's known wishes and values.

2. The intention of the testator prevails over the literal meaning of the words, where the intention is clearly established by other evidence.

3. Testaments are to be interpreted liberally to give effect to the testator's wishes and to avoid intestacy or failure of dispositions, provided such interpretation is consistent with the language used and the law.

4. In case of ambiguity or doubt, preference is to be given to interpretations that:
    a. uphold the validity of the testament and its dispositions;
    b. favour natural objects of the testator's bounty, such as family members;
    c. preserve equality among beneficiaries of the same class;
    d. avoid disinheritance of forced heirs without clear justification.

5. Technical legal terms are presumed to be used in their legal sense, unless the context indicates otherwise. Common words are to be understood in their ordinary meaning.

6. Where the testator uses general words followed by specific enumeration, the general words are restricted to things of the same kind as those enumerated (ejusdem generis).

7. Conditions and charges attached to dispositions are to be interpreted strictly. An impossible, unlawful, or immoral condition is deemed not written and does not affect the validity of the disposition, unless it was the sole motive for the disposition.

8. A disposition in favour of "children" includes all children recognized or adopted by the testator, unless the context indicates otherwise. It does not include grandchildren or more remote descendants unless clearly intended.

9. A disposition in favour of "heirs" without further specification is presumed to refer to legal heirs under the rules of intestacy, in the proportions they would inherit in the absence of the testament.

10. Dispositions in favour of the poor, charitable institutions, or pious purposes are to be interpreted broadly to effectuate the testator's charitable intention. If the specific beneficiary no longer exists or cannot be identified, the court may direct the disposition to a similar purpose (cy-près).

11. Where two or more dispositions are irreconcilable, the later disposition prevails. If both appear in the same testament, the more specific disposition prevails over the more general.

12. Dispositions conferring life interests, usufructs, or other limited rights are to be interpreted in favour of the remainderman or reversioner where doubt exists as to the extent or duration of the limited right.

13. Extrinsic evidence, including statements made by the testator, correspondence, and testimony of witnesses to the execution, may be admitted to resolve ambiguity or to prove the testator's intention, but may not contradict clear language of the testament.
