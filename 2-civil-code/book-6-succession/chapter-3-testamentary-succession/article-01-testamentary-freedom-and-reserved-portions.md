# Article 1 – Testamentary Freedom and Reserved Portions

1. Every person of sound mind and having attained the age of majority may dispose of their property by testament, subject to the rights of forced heirs.

2. Forced heirs are descendants, the surviving spouse or registered partner, and, in the absence of descendants and spouse, ascendants, who are entitled to a reserved portion of the estate that may not be disposed of by testament.

3. The reserved portion is:
    a. three-quarters of the estate where the deceased is survived by one child or descendant of a deceased child;
    b. four-fifths of the estate where the deceased is survived by two or more children or descendants;
    c. one-half of the estate where the deceased is survived by a spouse or registered partner but no descendants;
    d. one-third of the estate where the deceased is survived by ascendants but no descendants or spouse.

4. Where the deceased is survived by both descendants and a spouse or registered partner:
    a. the spouse is entitled to one-quarter of the estate as their reserved portion;
    b. the descendants share the remaining reserved portion (one-half if one child, seven-twelfths if multiple children);
    c. this allocation ensures that the total reserved portion is three-quarters or four-fifths of the estate.

5. The surviving spouse's reserved portion may not be reduced or eliminated by the deceased, except in cases of divorce proceedings pending at the time of death or where the spouse has been declared unworthy to succeed.

6. The testator may freely dispose of the disponible portion of the estate, being the remainder after deduction of the reserved portions, subject to estate taxation and social solidarity contributions as provided by law.

7. Dispositions by testament in excess of the disponible portion are subject to reduction at the instance of the forced heirs, to the extent necessary to restore the reserved portions.

8. Reduction is applied first to general legacies, then to specific legacies, and finally to dispositions in favour of heirs, in proportion to the value of each disposition.

9. Gifts made by the deceased during life are brought into account for purposes of calculating the reserved portions and may be subject to reduction if they exceed the disponible portion.

10. A forced heir who has received gifts or advantages from the deceased during life must bring them into account upon succession, unless the deceased expressly dispensed with this requirement.

11. Forced heirs may renounce their reserved portions by express declaration after the death of the testator, but may not renounce in advance during the lifetime of the testator.

12. Large estates are subject to progressive taxation to fund social welfare programs, with rates and thresholds established by law. Estate taxes take priority over legacies but not over forced heirs' reserved portions or essential debts of the estate.
