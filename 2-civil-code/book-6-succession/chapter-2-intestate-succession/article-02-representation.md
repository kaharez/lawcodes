# Article 2 – Representation

1. Representation is a legal fiction whereby descendants of a deceased heir take the place of that heir and succeed in the share that the heir would have taken if living.

2. Representation operates by operation of law and does not require acceptance by the representing party, except insofar as succession itself may be accepted or renounced.

3. Representation is permitted:
    a. in the direct descending line, without limit of degree, in favour of children, grandchildren, and more remote descendants of a predeceased child or descendant;
    b. in the collateral line, in favour of children of predeceased siblings of the deceased, whether siblings of the whole blood or half blood.

4. Representation is not permitted in the ascending line. Parents or other ascendants who predecease do not transmit their right to succeed to their own ascendants.

5. To represent, a person must be capable of succeeding to the deceased and must not be unworthy or excluded. The representing party succeeds in their own right, not as heir of the person represented.

6. Representation permits succession per stirpes rather than per capita:
    a. descendants of a predeceased child take collectively the share their parent would have taken;
    b. if there are multiple descendants, they divide that share equally among themselves;
    c. if any of them has also predeceased, their own descendants represent them in turn.

7. Representation operates even where the person represented:
    a. died before the deceased;
    b. renounced the succession;
    c. was declared unworthy, except where unworthiness extends to descendants by express provision of law.

8. A person who represents exercises all the rights and assumes all the obligations that the person represented would have had, including the right to claim reduction of excessive gifts, the duty to bring gifts into account, and the obligation to contribute to debts.

9. Where representation does not operate, succession devolves by degree: relatives of a nearer degree exclude those of a more remote degree, and relatives of the same degree succeed per capita in equal shares.
