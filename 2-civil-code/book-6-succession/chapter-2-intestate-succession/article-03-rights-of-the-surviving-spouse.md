# Article 3 – Rights of the Surviving Spouse

1. The surviving spouse or registered partner is a legal heir and succeeds in accordance with the provisions of this article, provided the marriage or partnership was valid and subsisting at the time of death.

2. The surviving spouse is excluded from succession if:
    (a) at the time of death, a petition for divorce or dissolution was pending and a decree of separation of property had been pronounced;
    (b) the spouse had been convicted of attempted homicide of the deceased or complicity therein;
    (c) the spouse had been declared unworthy for other serious misconduct toward the deceased.

3. Where the deceased is survived by descendants, the surviving spouse may elect either:
    (a) to receive one-quarter of the estate in full ownership; or
    (b) to receive the usufruct of the entire estate for life.

4. If the surviving spouse elects the usufruct, the descendants receive bare ownership. Upon the death of the surviving spouse, they acquire full ownership without further formalities.

5. The election must be made within one year of the opening of succession or, if the spouse was unaware of the death, within one year of becoming aware. If no election is made, the spouse is deemed to have elected ownership of one-quarter.

6. Where the deceased is survived by ascendants but no descendants, the surviving spouse receives:
    (a) one-half of the estate if both parents survive;
    (b) three-quarters of the estate if one parent survives;
    (c) the entire estate if no parent survives.

7. Where the deceased is survived by collateral relatives but no descendants or ascendants, the surviving spouse receives the entire estate.

8. In all cases, the surviving spouse has a preferential right to:
    (a) remain in the matrimonial home for a period of one year, rent-free;
    (b) retain household furnishings and personal effects, up to a reasonable value;
    (c) receive maintenance from the estate if left in need, charged against the estate as a whole.

9. The surviving spouse who receives usufruct of the entire estate or of specific property is not required to provide security, except in cases of waste, dissipation, or manifest risk to the interests of the bare owners.

10. The surviving spouse's right to succeed is personal and may not be assigned, alienated, or renounced in advance. The spouse may, however, renounce the succession after it has opened, in the same manner as other heirs.

11. Rights of maintenance and support of the surviving spouse take priority over the rights of other heirs and legatees and must be satisfied before distribution of the estate.
