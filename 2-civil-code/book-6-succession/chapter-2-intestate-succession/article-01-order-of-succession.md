# Article 1 – Order of Succession

1. In the absence of a testament, or insofar as a testament does not dispose of the entire estate, succession devolves by operation of law to the relatives of the deceased and, failing relatives, to the state.

2. The order of succession is:
    (a) descendants;
    (b) spouse or surviving partner;
    (c) ascendants and collateral relatives;
    (d) the state.

3. Relatives of a nearer degree exclude relatives of a more remote degree, except in cases of representation.

4. Descendants inherit in equal shares per stirpes. If a descendant has predeceased, their share passes to their own descendants by representation.

5. The surviving spouse or registered partner inherits:
    (a) in concurrence with descendants, one-quarter of the estate or the usufruct of the entire estate, at the choice of the spouse;
    (b) in concurrence with ascendants, one-half of the estate;
    (c) in the absence of descendants and ascendants, the entire estate.

6. Parents inherit in equal shares. If one parent has predeceased, their share accrues to the surviving parent, unless the deceased has siblings, in which case it is divided equally between the surviving parent and the siblings.

7. Siblings of the whole blood inherit in equal shares. Siblings of the half blood inherit half the share of siblings of the whole blood.

8. In the absence of descendants, spouse, ascendants, and siblings, succession devolves to other collateral relatives up to the sixth degree, with nearer degrees excluding more remote degrees.

9. Relatives beyond the sixth degree do not succeed. In their absence, the estate devolves to the state as bona vacantia.

10. Representation allows descendants of a predeceased heir to take the share that the predeceased heir would have taken. Representation is permitted in the direct descending line and in the collateral line in favour of children of siblings.
