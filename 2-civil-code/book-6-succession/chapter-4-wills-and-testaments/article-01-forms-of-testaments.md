# Article 1 – Forms of Testaments

1. A testament is a revocable declaration of the testator's will regarding the disposition of their property after death.

2. Testaments must comply with the formalities prescribed by law. A testament that does not comply with legal formalities is null and void.

3. The forms of testament recognised by law are:
    a. holographic testament;
    b. notarial testament;
    c. secret testament;
    d. international testament.

4. A holographic testament is one written entirely in the hand of the testator, dated, and signed. No other formality is required. Holographic testaments must be deposited with a notary or the competent registry for safekeeping.

5. A notarial testament is one dictated by the testator to a notary in the presence of two witnesses, read back to the testator, and signed by the testator, the notary, and the witnesses. The notary retains the original and issues certified copies.

6. A secret testament is one written by the testator or a third party, placed in a sealed envelope, and delivered to a notary in the presence of two witnesses. The testator declares that the envelope contains their testament, and the notary makes a record of the deposit on the envelope, signed by the testator, the notary, and the witnesses.

7. An international testament is one executed in accordance with the Convention on the Form of an International Will, providing a uniform form recognised in multiple jurisdictions.

8. Military testaments and maritime testaments may be executed in simplified forms by persons on active military service or seafarers on board ship, in accordance with special provisions of law, but cease to have effect six months after the testator returns to ordinary circumstances.

9. A testament may not be made by proxy or through representation. Joint or mutual testaments by two or more persons in the same instrument are prohibited.

10. A testament may be revoked at any time by the testator by:
    a. executing a new testament expressly revoking the prior testament;
    b. destroying the testament with the intention to revoke;
    c. executing a new testament inconsistent with the prior testament, which revokes it to the extent of the inconsistency.
