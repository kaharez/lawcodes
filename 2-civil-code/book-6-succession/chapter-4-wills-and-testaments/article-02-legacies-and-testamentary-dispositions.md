# Article 2 – Legacies and Testamentary Dispositions

1. A legacy is a testamentary disposition granting property or a right to a legatee.

2. Legacies may be:
    (a) universal, granting the entire estate or a fraction thereof;
    (b) of a quota, granting a specified portion of the estate;
    (c) particular, granting a specific item of property or a right.

3. A universal legatee succeeds to the entire estate not otherwise disposed of and is liable for all debts and obligations of the deceased, without limit.

4. A legatee of a quota succeeds to the specified portion and is liable for debts and obligations pro rata to the quota received.

5. A particular legatee receives only the specific property or right bequeathed and is not liable for debts of the estate, except to the extent that the legacy is reduced to satisfy creditors or forced heirs.

6. Where a legacy of specific property fails because the property no longer belongs to the testator or has been destroyed, the legatee receives nothing, unless the testament provides otherwise or the loss was caused by the fault of an heir.

7. A legacy subject to a condition or term takes effect only upon fulfilment of the condition or arrival of the term. If the condition is impossible or unlawful, the legacy is void.

8. A legacy may be revoked expressly by a subsequent testament, or tacitly by alienation or destruction of the property bequeathed with the intention to revoke.

9. Legacies bear fruits and generate interest from the date of death, unless the testament specifies otherwise or the legacy is subject to a suspensive term.

10. Where multiple legacies exceed the disponible portion of the estate or the value of the assets, legacies are reduced proportionately, except that particular legacies designated as preferred by the testator are satisfied before others.

11. A legacy lapses and becomes void if:
    (a) the legatee predeceases the testator or is unworthy to succeed;
    (b) the legatee renounces the legacy;
    (c) the condition upon which the legacy depends fails definitively.

12. Where a legacy to a descendant lapses, the descendants of the legatee may succeed by representation, unless the testament provides otherwise.
