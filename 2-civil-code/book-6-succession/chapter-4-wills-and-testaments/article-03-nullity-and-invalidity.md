# Article 3 – Nullity and Invalidity

1. A testament is null and void if it fails to comply with the formalities prescribed by law for its form. Nullity for defect of form is absolute and may be invoked by any interested party at any time.

2. A testament is voidable if the testator:
    (a) lacked capacity at the time of execution due to minority, mental incapacity, or other legal disability;
    (b) was subject to error, fraud, duress, or undue influence that vitiated consent;
    (c) executed the testament under such circumstances as to deprive it of legal effect.

3. A testament executed by a person of sound mind is presumed valid. The burden of proving incapacity, error, fraud, duress, or undue influence rests upon the party challenging the testament.

4. Mental incapacity sufficient to invalidate a testament includes:
    (a) insanity, dementia, or other mental illness depriving the testator of understanding;
    (b) temporary incapacity due to intoxication, delirium, or medication;
    (c) weakness of mind rendering the testator unable to comprehend the nature and effect of the testament.

5. A testament is not invalid merely because the testator suffered from mental illness or declining faculties, provided the testator possessed sufficient understanding (lucid interval) at the time of execution.

6. Error vitiates consent if it relates to:
    (a) the nature of the instrument (e.g., the testator believed they were signing a different document);
    (b) the identity of the beneficiary, where identity was decisive;
    (c) the object disposed of, where the error is fundamental and determinative.

7. Fraud consists of intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material facts for the purpose of inducing the testator to make or revoke a disposition. Fraud vitiates the disposition procured by fraud.

8. Duress consists of threats or violence causing the testator to act against their will. Duress vitiates the entire testament or the disposition procured under duress.

9. Undue influence consists of improper pressure, manipulation, or exploitation of a relationship of trust, authority, or dependency to procure a disposition in favour of the influencer or a third party. Where undue influence is proven, the disposition is voidable.

10. Undue influence is presumed where:
    (a) a person in a fiduciary or confidential relationship with the testator receives a substantial benefit;
    (b) the testator was dependent upon or subject to the influence of the beneficiary;
    (c) the disposition is unnatural or contrary to the testator's known wishes and family circumstances.

11. The presumption of undue influence may be rebutted by proving:
    (a) the testator acted freely and independently;
    (b) the testator received independent advice;
    (c) the disposition is consistent with the testator's values and prior declarations.

12. A partial nullity affects only the invalid disposition. The remainder of the testament stands unless the invalid disposition was so essential that the testator would not have made the testament without it.

13. An action to declare a testament null or voidable must be brought within five years of the opening of succession, or within two years of discovery of the fraud, error, or duress, whichever is later, and in any event within ten years of the opening of succession.

14. Where a testament is declared null or voidable, succession devolves as if the testament had never existed, in accordance with the rules of intestacy or, if there is a prior valid testament, in accordance with that testament.
