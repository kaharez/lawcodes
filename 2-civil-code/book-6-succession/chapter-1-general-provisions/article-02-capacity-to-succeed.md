# Article 2 – Capacity to Succeed

1. To succeed, a person must exist at the time of the opening of succession. A person is deemed to exist from the moment of conception, provided they are subsequently born alive.

2. Children conceived but not yet born at the time of the opening of succession succeed provisionally, subject to their being born alive. If born dead, they are deemed never to have existed for purposes of succession.

3. Juridical persons capable of succeeding include:
    a. legal entities existing at the time of the opening of succession;
    b. legal entities to be constituted pursuant to the testament, provided they are actually constituted within the period specified or, in the absence thereof, within two years of the opening of succession;
    c. the state and other public entities.

4. Succession to property of a person who has disappeared without trace is governed by special provisions regarding declaration of death. Until death is declared, the estate is placed under provisional administration.

5. The following lack capacity to succeed or to receive by testament:
    a. persons convicted of homicide of the deceased or complicity therein, except in cases of legitimate self-defence or excusable homicide;
    b. persons who, by fraud, duress, or violence, induced or prevented the deceased from making, revoking, or modifying their testament;
    c. persons who concealed, suppressed, falsified, or destroyed the testament of the deceased;
    d. such other persons as may be declared unworthy by judicial decree for serious misconduct toward the deceased.

6. Unworthiness must be declared by judicial decree upon petition of an interested party. The unworthy person is excluded from succession but remains liable for debts of the estate to the extent of any benefit received.

7. Unworthiness does not affect the rights of descendants of the unworthy person to succeed in their own right by representation or in their own degree.

8. The deceased may, by testament or authentic instrument executed after the act giving rise to unworthiness, expressly forgive the unworthy person and restore their capacity to succeed. Such forgiveness is personal and does not extend to accomplices or other unworthy persons.
