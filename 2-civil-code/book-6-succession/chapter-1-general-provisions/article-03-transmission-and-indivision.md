# Article 3 – Transmission and Indivision

1. Upon the death of a person, their estate is transmitted immediately to their heirs and legatees, who acquire ownership from the moment of death, subject to acceptance or renunciation.

2. The maxim "the dead seizes the living" (le mort saisit le vif) applies: heirs are deemed to have possession of the estate from the moment of death, without need for actual taking of possession.

3. Until partition, the estate is held in indivision by all co-heirs. Each co-heir has an undivided share in the entire estate and may exercise the rights of an owner subject to the rights of other co-heirs.

4. During indivision, no co-heir may perform acts of disposition affecting the entire estate without the consent of all co-heirs. Acts of preservation and ordinary administration may be performed by any co-heir or by a majority.

5. Each co-heir is entitled to their proportionate share of the fruits, revenues, and benefits of the estate. Each co-heir must contribute proportionately to the preservation, maintenance, and administration of the estate.

6. A co-heir may alienate their undivided share to a third party, but other co-heirs have a right of pre-emption to acquire the share in preference to the third party, exercisable within one month of notification.

7. Creditors of a co-heir may attach and sell the co-heir's undivided share in satisfaction of their claims, but may not compel partition except by judicial authorization.

8. Any co-heir may at any time demand partition of the estate, unless partition has been excluded by the deceased for a specified period not exceeding ten years, renewable by agreement.

9. Partition terminates indivision and attributes specific assets to each co-heir in proportion to their share. Upon partition, each co-heir is deemed to have been the sole owner of the assets attributed to them from the moment of death.

10. During indivision, co-heirs owe each other duties of good faith, loyalty, and cooperation in the management and preservation of the estate. A co-heir who breaches these duties may be held liable for damages.
