1. Evidence of other acts by the accused is generally inadmissible.

2. Similar fact evidence is admissible if its probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect.

3. It may be admissible to show:
   a. modus operandi (distinctive pattern);
   b. identity;
   c. intent;
   d. absence of mistake or accident;
   e. rebutting defenses.

4. Propensity evidence alone is insufficient.
