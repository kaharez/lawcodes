# Article 3 – Illegally Obtained Evidence

1. Evidence obtained by unlawful means may be excluded if:
   a. admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute;
   b. it was obtained in flagrant violation of rights;
   c. exclusion is proportionate to the breach.

2. In criminal cases, evidence obtained in violation of rights is generally excluded unless admission is necessary to prevent miscarriage of justice.
