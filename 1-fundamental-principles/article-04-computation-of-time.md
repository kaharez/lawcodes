# Article 4 – Computation of Time

1. Time limits established by law or juridical act are computed according to the following rules.

2. Where a period is expressed in days, it is computed in clear days, meaning that the day on which the period begins and the day on which it ends are not counted.

3. Where a period is expressed in months or years, it expires on the day of the last month or year that corresponds numerically to the day on which the period began. If the last month has no corresponding day, the period expires on the last day of that month.

4. Where a period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, it is extended to the next working day.

5. Periods expressed in hours are computed continuously from the moment they begin, without regard to days or holidays.

6. Where the law prescribes that an act must be done within a certain time, the act is timely if completed before the expiry of the last day of the period or, if the act requires filing or delivery, if filed or delivered before the end of business hours on the last day.

7. Time limits prescribed by law are generally mandatory and may not be extended by agreement, except where the law expressly permits. Time limits agreed by the parties may be extended or abridged by mutual consent.

8. Prescription and limitation periods are suspended during periods when the right-holder is unable to act due to force majeure or legal impediment, and are interrupted by judicial demand, acknowledgment by the debtor, or other acts specified by law.

9. Unless otherwise provided, references to age are computed in completed years from the date of birth. A person attains majority on the day preceding the anniversary of their eighteenth birthday.
