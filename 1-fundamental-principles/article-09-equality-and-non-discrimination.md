# Article 9 – Equality and Non-Discrimination

1. All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination.

2. Every person has the right to be treated with equal dignity and respect, and to have their human worth recognized regardless of personal characteristics.

3. No person shall be discriminated against on the basis of:
   (a) race, color, ethnicity, or national origin;
   (b) sex, gender, or sexual orientation;
   (c) religion or belief;
   (d) language;
   (e) political or other opinion;
   (f) social origin or economic status;
   (g) disability or health status;
   (h) age;
   (i) or any other status.

4. Discrimination means any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on prohibited grounds that has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of rights on an equal footing.

5. Differential treatment is not discriminatory if it:
   (a) pursues a legitimate aim;
   (b) is objectively and reasonably justified;
   (c) is proportionate to the aim pursued.

6. Special measures designed to accelerate equality for persons or groups disadvantaged by discrimination do not constitute discrimination and are expressly permitted.

7. Equality between nationals and foreigners is not required where differential treatment is objectively justified by nationality or immigration status, but all persons are entitled to fundamental human rights regardless of nationality.

8. Men and women have equal rights in all spheres of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural life. Laws and practices that discriminate against women are prohibited.

9. The State shall take positive measures to promote substantive equality and to eliminate systemic discrimination, particularly against historically disadvantaged groups.

10. This Article does not affect the special status of the Royal House or the constitutional position of the Sovereign as established in Article 1.
