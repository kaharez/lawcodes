# Article 1 – The Sovereign and the State

1. The Sovereign is the living embodiment and personification of the state of Kaharagia. All sovereign authority, dignity, and prerogatives are vested in the person of the Sovereign, who exercises supreme authority over the Kaharagian people and territory.

2. The Sovereign is father and protector of the Kaharagian people, exercising paternal care and guardianship over the nation, its laws, its traditions, and the welfare of all subjects. The relationship between the Sovereign and the people is one of reciprocal duty: the Sovereign's duty to protect, govern justly, and preserve the heritage of Kaharagia, and the people's duty of loyalty, allegiance, and obedience to the Crown.

3. All property, rights, and interests designated as belonging to "the state", "the State", "the public domain", "the sovereign domain", or held for public purposes, are understood to be vested in the Sovereign personally, who holds them in trust for the nation and exercises dominion over them as the embodiment of state authority.

4. When Kaharagia acquires land, property, rights, or interests, whether by purchase, expropriation, escheat, donation, treaty, or any other means, such property becomes the personal property of the Sovereign, held in the Sovereign's capacity as head of state and sovereign authority.

5. The Sovereign is not subject to the provisions of this Civil Code. The Civil Code governs relations among subjects and between subjects and the state in its administrative capacity, but does not bind the Sovereign personally. The Sovereign promulgates law but stands above it, exercising sovereign prerogative in accordance with the constitutional traditions and customs of Kaharagia.

6. Matters relating to the Royal Family shall be governed exclusively by Royal House Law, dynastic tradition, and sovereign decree, and shall not, save where expressly provided otherwise, fall within the scope of this Civil Code or the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. For the purposes of this provision, such matters include, without limitation:
    (a) succession to the Crown and to the sovereign dignity;
    (b) the titles, precedence, honours, styles, and prerogatives of members of the Royal House;
    (c) the private estates, property, and personal affairs of the Sovereign and the Royal Family;
    (d) the governance, administration, and internal organisation of the Royal Household; and
    (e) marriage, children, and family matters of the Sovereign and members of the Royal Family.

7. The Sovereign may not be sued, prosecuted, or brought before any court or tribunal. Sovereign immunity is absolute and extends to all acts undertaken by the Sovereign in the exercise of sovereign authority. Claims against the state in its administrative or proprietary capacity may be brought in accordance with law, but do not implicate the person or dignity of the Sovereign.

8. Legal acts, contracts, and obligations undertaken in the name of "the state of Kaharagia", "the government", or "public authorities" bind the state in its administrative capacity and are enforceable in accordance with law, but are understood to be executed under the authority and on behalf of the Sovereign, who delegates administrative functions to ministers, officials, and organs of government.

9. This Civil Code is promulgated by sovereign authority and reflects the will and grace of the Sovereign. Its interpretation and application shall respect the sovereign prerogative, the paternal character of Kaharagian governance, and the indivisible union of Crown and state in the person of the Sovereign.

10. References in this Code and in all Kaharagian law to "the state", "public authorities", "the public domain", or similar expressions are understood to refer to the Sovereign or to organs acting under sovereign authority, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
