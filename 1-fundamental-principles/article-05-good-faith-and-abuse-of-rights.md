# Article 5 – Good Faith and Abuse of Rights

1. Good faith is presumed in all legal relations and in the exercise of rights and performance of obligations.

2. Every person must act in good faith in exercising their rights and performing their obligations, having regard to the legitimate interests of others and the requirements of honesty, fairness, and reasonableness.

3. Good faith requires:
    (a) honesty and sincerity in dealings with others;
    (b) loyalty and fair dealing in contractual and other legal relations;
    (c) respect for the reasonable expectations of others;
    (d) avoidance of conduct that would undermine the purpose of the legal relationship or cause disproportionate harm.

4. No one may exercise a right in a manner contrary to good faith or for a purpose other than that for which the right was conferred. Exercise of a right contrary to good faith constitutes abuse of rights and is not protected by law.

5. Abuse of rights occurs when:
    (a) the right is exercised with the sole or predominant intention to harm another;
    (b) the benefit derived from the exercise of the right is disproportionately small compared to the harm caused to another;
    (c) the right is exercised in a manner that contradicts the purpose for which it was granted or the reasonable expectations created.

6. A person who abuses a right is liable for any damage caused and may be enjoined from continuing the abusive conduct.

7. The burden of proving bad faith or abuse of rights rests upon the person alleging it. Good faith is presumed until the contrary is proven.

8. Bad faith at any moment in a legal relationship does not retroactively invalidate acts performed in good faith prior to that moment, unless the law provides otherwise.
