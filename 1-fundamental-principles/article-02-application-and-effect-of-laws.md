# Article 2 – Application and Effect of Laws

1. The Fundamental Principles apply to all Kaharagian laws and codes. Every provision of civil, criminal, procedural, and evidentiary law shall be interpreted and applied consistently with these Principles, which guide the coherence of the entire legal order unless a specific law expressly provides otherwise.

2. The general provisions of each code operate subject to these Fundamental Principles. Where a code establishes a special rule that departs from a Fundamental Principle, the special rule prevails only to the extent of the express and necessary departure.

3. The Civil Code governs the civil status, family relations, property rights, and private obligations of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Kaharagia and shall be read in harmony with the Fundamental Principles.

4. Laws enter into force upon their official publication, or on the date specified in the law itself. In the absence of specification, laws enter into force on the date of publication.

5. Laws have prospective effect only and do not apply to acts, facts, or situations that occurred or were completed before their entry into force, unless the law expressly provides otherwise or unless retroactive application is necessary to give effect to fundamental rights.

6. Vested rights acquired under previous legislation are respected. New laws may not divest rights validly acquired, except where required by public interest with just compensation or where the law expressly provides for transitional arrangements.

7. Laws may not be repealed except by subsequent legislation or by express abrogation. Implicit repeal occurs only to the extent that the new law is irreconcilable with the prior law.

8. Ignorance of the law is no excuse and does not exempt any person from compliance, except where excusable error of law is recognised as a defence.

9. Custom and usage have the force of law where the law expressly refers to them, or in matters not regulated by law, provided they are not contrary to law, public order, or morals.

10. In cases not regulated by law, custom, or usage, the judge shall decide according to general principles of law, equity, and the nature of analogous legal relations.
