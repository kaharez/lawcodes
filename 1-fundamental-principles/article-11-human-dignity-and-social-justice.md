# Article 11 – Human Dignity and Social Justice

1. Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected by all authorities and by all persons.

2. Every person has inherent worth and is entitled to be treated as an end in themselves, never merely as a means to another's ends.

3. The State recognizes that the welfare of the individual is bound to the welfare of the community, and that social solidarity and mutual responsibility are essential to a just society.

4. The State shall promote social justice and shall take measures to:
   a. ensure that all persons have access to adequate food, water, housing, and health care;
   b. promote education and the development of human potential;
   c. provide social security and assistance to those in need;
   d. protect workers and ensure fair conditions of employment;
   e. promote economic opportunity and reduce inequality;
   f. protect the environment for present and future generations.

5. Special protection is owed to vulnerable persons, including:
   a. children, whose best interests must be a primary consideration in all actions concerning them;
   b. the elderly, persons with disabilities, and others unable to fully protect their own interests;
   c. victims of exploitation, abuse, or violence.

6. Every person has duties to the community and to other persons. The exercise of rights must have regard to the rights of others and to the requirements of public welfare, morals, and order.

7. No person shall be subjected to exploitation, including:
   a. slavery, servitude, or forced labor;
   b. human trafficking;
   c. economic exploitation or the unjust deprivation of the fruits of one's labor.

8. The State shall promote sustainable development and shall protect the natural environment as a heritage held in trust for future generations.

9. The State shall respect and protect cultural diversity, and shall promote understanding and tolerance among all communities within Kaharagia.

10. The State has a duty to govern with paternal care for the welfare of all subjects, in accordance with the constitutional philosophy of Kaharagia, and to ensure that development benefits all members of society, particularly the most disadvantaged.

11. These principles of social justice guide the interpretation and application of all laws and inform the development of public policy, but do not of themselves create justiciable rights except as implemented through specific legislation.
