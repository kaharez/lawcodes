# Article 3 – Interpretation of Laws

1. Laws are to be interpreted according to their ordinary and natural meaning, having regard to the context, the purpose of the legislation, and the intention of the legislator.

2. Where the language of the law is clear and unambiguous, it must be applied according to its literal meaning. Resort to other methods of interpretation is permitted only where the language is ambiguous or leads to absurd or unjust results.

3. In interpreting laws, preference is to be given to interpretations that:
    (a) give effect to fundamental rights and principles of justice;
    (b) promote legal certainty and consistency;
    (c) respect vested rights and legitimate expectations;
    (d) are compatible with international obligations of the state.

4. Special laws derogate from general laws to the extent of any inconsistency. Later laws prevail over earlier laws.

5. Exceptions, restrictions on rights, and penal provisions are to be interpreted strictly and may not be extended by analogy.

6. Where two interpretations are equally plausible, the interpretation more favourable to the person whose rights or liberty are at stake is to be preferred.

7. Provisions establishing substantive rights are to be interpreted broadly. Provisions establishing formalities or procedures are to be interpreted reasonably to give effect to their purpose without imposing unnecessary burdens.

8. Legislative materials, preparatory works, and parliamentary debates may be consulted to ascertain the intention of the legislator, but are not binding.
