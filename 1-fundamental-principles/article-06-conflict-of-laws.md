# Article 6 – Conflict of Laws

1. The civil status and capacity of a person are governed by the law of their nationality. Where a person has multiple nationalities, the law of the nationality with which the person has the closest connection applies.

2. The form of juridical acts is governed by the law of the place where the act is performed (locus regit actum). An act that complies with the formal requirements of the place of performance is valid as to form, even if the law governing the substance of the act requires different formalities.

3. Alternatively, the form of a juridical act may comply with the law governing the substance of the act, or with the law of the domicile or nationality of any party.

4. The substance of contractual obligations is governed by the law chosen by the parties. In the absence of choice, it is governed by the law of the country with which the contract has the closest connection, generally the law of the place of performance or the law of the habitual residence of the party whose performance is characteristic.

5. The substance of non-contractual obligations arising from delict or unjust enrichment is governed by the law of the place where the damage occurred or the enrichment took place, unless the parties have a closer connection with another country.

6. Ownership and other real rights over immovable property are governed by the law of the place where the immovable is situated (lex rei sitae).

7. Ownership and other real rights over movable property are governed by the law of the place where the movable is situated at the time the right is created, subject to exceptions for movables in transit or habitually moved between countries.

8. Succession to the estate of a deceased person is governed by the law of the nationality of the deceased at the time of death, except as regards immovable property, which is governed by the law of the situs.

9. Foreign law is applied as a matter of fact and must be proven by the party invoking it. The court may take judicial notice of foreign law or order its ascertainment through appropriate means.

10. Foreign law is not applied if its application would be manifestly contrary to public policy of the state. In such cases, the law of the state applies.

11. Public policy includes fundamental principles of the legal order, mandatory rules protecting overriding public interests, and essential human rights and freedoms.
