# Article 2 – Unlawful Use of Sovereign or State Authority

1. Any person who falsely claims, assumes, or exercises the authority of The Sovereign, a State office, or a public commission commits an offence.

2. Unlawful use of authority includes:
    a. representing oneself as holding a State office or commission without lawful appointment;
    b. issuing, transmitting, or publishing any document, order, proclamation, or message purporting to originate from the Sovereign or the State;
    c. impersonating State officials or authorised representatives;
    d. using digital means to simulate State authentication, signatures, seals, or systems.

3. This offence is punishable within Penalty Band D, given the serious threat it poses to public trust and national integrity.
