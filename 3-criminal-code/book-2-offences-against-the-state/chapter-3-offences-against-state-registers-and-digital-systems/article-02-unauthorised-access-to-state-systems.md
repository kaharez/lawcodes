# Article 2 – Unauthorised Access to State Systems

1. Any person who intentionally accesses, attempts to access, or enables another to access a protected State system without lawful authority commits an offence.

2. A “protected State system” includes:
    (a) identity verification systems;
    (b) digital registers and archives;
    (c) government communication networks;
    (d) cryptographic keys, signing servers, and authentication infrastructure.

3. This offence is punishable within Penalty Band C, or Penalty Band D where the act involves bypassing security controls or jeopardises system integrity.

4. If the unauthorised access is carried out for the purpose of committing another offence, the penalty shall be increased to the next higher band.
