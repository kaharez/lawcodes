# Article 2 – Unlawful Enrichment

1. Unlawful enrichment is the possession of assets or wealth by a public official that are significantly disproportionate to their lawful income and that the official cannot satisfactorily explain the lawful origin of.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "public official" includes current and former holders of public office, as defined in Book 6, Chapter 1, Article 1;
    (b) "assets" includes money, property, investments, and any other form of wealth or economic benefit;
    (c) "lawful income" includes salaries, legitimate business income, inheritances, gifts from family members, and other lawfully acquired wealth; and
    (d) significant disproportionality is established where the assets exceed lawful income by a substantial margin that cannot be reasonably explained.

3. The burden of proof is on the public official to demonstrate the lawful origin of assets once the prosecution has established prima facie evidence of disproportionality.

4. Unlawful enrichment is punished under Penalty Band E, with mandatory disqualification from holding public office.

5. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the disproportionality is very substantial or involves assets of great value;
    (b) the enrichment is connected to corruption, bribery, or abuse of office;
    (c) the official took steps to conceal assets through offshore accounts, nominees, or complex structures;
    (d) the official made false declarations or provided false information about assets;
    (e) the official held a senior or particularly trusted position; or
    (f) the offender has previous findings or convictions for corruption or abuse of office.

6. The court shall order confiscation of all assets that the official cannot demonstrate were lawfully acquired.

7. Public officials have a duty to declare assets and interests in accordance with laws and regulations. False declarations or failure to declare assets is punishable under Penalty Band C.

8. This Article applies to assets acquired during the period of holding public office and for a reasonable period before and after, as prescribed by law.

9. This Article gives effect to international anti-corruption standards and asset declaration requirements.
