# Article 1 – Abuse of Office

1. Abuse of office is the intentional or reckless abuse of powers, authority, or discretion by a public official for the purpose of obtaining an advantage for themselves or another, or causing harm or disadvantage to another, in violation of law or official duties.

2. Abuse of office includes:
    (a) using official position or authority for personal gain or the benefit of family members or associates;
    (b) acting in conflict of interest without proper disclosure or authorization;
    (c) misusing official information for personal advantage;
    (d) abusing discretionary powers for improper purposes;
    (e) showing favoritism, bias, or discrimination in the exercise of official duties;
    (f) using official resources, facilities, or personnel for private purposes;
    (g) making decisions or taking actions beyond legal authority or in violation of procedural requirements;
    (h) engaging in nepotism or cronyism in appointments, contracts, or benefits; or
    (i) any other misuse of public office or official authority.

3. Abuse of office is punished under Penalty Band D, with mandatory disqualification from holding public office.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the abuse results in substantial loss to the State or public interest;
    (b) the abuse results in substantial gain for the official or others;
    (c) the abuse concerns matters of significant public importance;
    (d) the official holds a senior or particularly trusted position;
    (e) the abuse is systematic or prolonged;
    (f) the abuse facilitates other serious crimes; or
    (g) the offender has previous convictions for abuse of office or related offences.

5. It is not a defence that the official acted in good faith or believed their conduct was lawful, unless the belief was objectively reasonable and the official took appropriate steps to ascertain their legal authority.

6. The court may order restitution, confiscation of gains, and permanent disqualification from public service.
