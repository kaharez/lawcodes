    (c) leaking information to damage the State, public interest, or individuals;
    (d) selling or trading in official information;
    (e) using official information to benefit family members, associates, or third parties;
    (f) disclosing information protected by official secrecy, privacy laws, or data protection requirements;
    (g) unauthorized access to official databases or information systems to obtain information; or
    (h) any other exploitation of official information for improper purposes.

3. Misuse of official information is punished under Penalty Band D, with mandatory disqualification from holding public office.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:

    (b) the misuse results in substantial financial gain or causes significant harm;
    (c) the misuse involves systematic disclosure or sale of information;

    (f) the official held a position of particular trust or access to sensitive information; or
    (g) the offender has previous convictions for misuse of information or breach of trust.

5. Unauthorized disclosure of information that exposes serious wrongdoing, illegality, or threats to public health or safety (whistleblowing) may be a defence if:
    (a) the disclosure was made in good faith and in the public interest;
    (b) the disclosure was made through appropriate channels or to competent authorities;
    (c) the information disclosed evidence of serious violations or dangers; and
    (d) there was no other reasonable means of addressing the wrongdoing.

6. Legitimate disclosure of information in accordance with freedom of information laws, transparency requirements, or pursuant to legal process is not an offence under this Article.

7. The court may order confiscation of proceeds obtained through misuse of official information, and may order protective measures for affected persons or entities.
