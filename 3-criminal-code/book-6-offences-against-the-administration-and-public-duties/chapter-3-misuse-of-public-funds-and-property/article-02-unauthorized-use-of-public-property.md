    (f) allowing unauthorized persons to use public property or facilities;
    (g) converting public property to private use or benefit; or
    (h) any other unauthorized exploitation of public assets or resources.

3. Unauthorized use of public property is punished under Penalty Band C, with disqualification from holding public office where committed by public officials.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the unauthorized use is systematic, prolonged, or substantial in value;
    (b) the unauthorized use involves valuable assets or significant resources;
    (c) the unauthorized use is for commercial purposes or generates income;

    (g) the offender has previous convictions for misuse of public property or corruption.

5. Private persons who use public property without authorization, including through corruption, false pretenses, or trespass, are subject to the penalties under this Article.

6. The court may order payment for the value of use, restoration of property, and compensation for damage or loss.

7. Legitimate use of public property for official purposes, or de minimis personal use permitted by policy or custom (such as occasional personal phone calls), is not an offence under this Article.
