# Article 1 – Bribery of Public Officials

1. Bribery of a public official is the offering, promising, giving, requesting, receiving, or accepting of any undue advantage, benefit, or consideration, directly or indirectly, to or by a public official, in connection with the performance or non-performance of official duties.

2. For the purposes of this Chapter:
    (a) "public official" includes any person holding legislative, executive, administrative, or judicial office, whether appointed or elected, permanent or temporary, paid or unpaid, and regardless of seniority;
    (b) "undue advantage" includes money, gifts, favours, services, employment, or any other benefit to which the official is not lawfully entitled; and
    (c) bribery includes both active bribery (offering or giving) and passive bribery (requesting or receiving).

3. Active bribery is committed by any person who offers, promises, or gives an undue advantage to a public official for the purpose of:
    (a) influencing the official to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of official duties;
    (b) inducing the official to abuse their position or authority;
    (c) obtaining favorable treatment, decisions, or outcomes; or
    (d) rewarding the official for past conduct in connection with official duties.

4. Passive bribery is committed by any public official who requests, receives, or accepts an undue advantage in connection with the exercise or non-exercise of official duties.

5. Active bribery is punished under Penalty Band E.

6. Passive bribery is punished under Penalty Band E, with mandatory disqualification from holding public office.

7. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the bribery involves substantial amounts or benefits;
    (b) the bribery concerns judicial decisions, law enforcement, or matters of significant public importance;
    (c) the bribery is systematic or involves multiple officials or transactions;
    (d) the official holds a senior or particularly trusted position;
    (e) the bribery undermines public confidence in institutions or the administration of justice;
    (f) the bribery facilitates other serious crimes, including trafficking, money laundering, or organized crime; or
    (g) the offender has previous convictions for corruption or bribery.

8. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the official would have acted in the same manner without the bribe;
    (b) the bribe was customary or expected;
    (c) the official did not have authority over the matter in question; or
    (d) the advantage was given or received after the official act.

9. The court may order confiscation of all bribes, benefits, and proceeds, and shall impose disqualification from holding public office.

10. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered in cases of grave or systematic corruption.
