1. Trading in influence is the act of offering, promising, giving, requesting, receiving, or accepting an undue advantage for the purpose of exerting improper influence over the decision-making of a public official or person in a position of authority.

2. Trading in influence includes:
    a. offering or receiving benefits in exchange for using one's influence, real or supposed, to affect decisions of public officials;
    b. acting as an intermediary in bribery schemes, facilitating corrupt payments between parties;
    c. soliciting or accepting benefits in exchange for promising to influence official decisions, even without authority to do so;
    d. offering benefits to persons close to public officials for the purpose of influencing those officials;
    e. leveraging political, social, or professional connections for corrupt purposes; or

    e. the influence trading undermines public confidence in institutions or governance;
    f. the influence trading facilitates other serious crimes; or
