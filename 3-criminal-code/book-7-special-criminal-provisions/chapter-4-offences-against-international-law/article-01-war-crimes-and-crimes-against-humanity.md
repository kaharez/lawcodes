    i. using children as soldiers or for military purposes;
    j. pillage, unlawful destruction, or appropriation of property; or
    k. any other serious violation of international humanitarian law.

2. Crimes against humanity are acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, including:
    a. murder, extermination, or mass killing;
    b. enslavement or deportation;
    c. imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
    d. torture;
    e. rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, or other forms of sexual violence;

    h. apartheid or other inhumane acts of similar character causing great suffering or serious injury; or
    i. genocide, meaning acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.

3. War crimes and crimes against humanity are punished under Penalty Band E, with mandatory life imprisonment or the most severe penalty available under Kaharagian law for the most grave offences.

4. There is no statute of limitations for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide.

5. Official capacity, superior orders, or command responsibility are not defences to these offences, except where:
    a. superior orders may be considered in mitigation if the accused had no moral choice and the order was not manifestly unlawful; or
    b. the accused proves they lacked effective control or knowledge of the crimes committed by subordinates, where charged with command responsibility.

6. The court shall recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered in all cases of conviction for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide.

7. The State of Kaharagia may exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed by any person anywhere in the world, and shall cooperate with international tribunals and courts in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.

8. This Article gives effect to Kaharagia's obligations under international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law.
