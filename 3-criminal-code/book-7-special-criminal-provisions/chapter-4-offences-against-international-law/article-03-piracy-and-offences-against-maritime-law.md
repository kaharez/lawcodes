# Article 3 – Piracy and Offences Against Maritime Law

1. Piracy is any illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private vessel or aircraft against another vessel, aircraft, or persons or property on board, on the high seas or in places outside the jurisdiction of any State.

2. Piracy includes:
    a. attacking, seizing, or destroying vessels or aircraft on the high seas;
    b. robbery, violence, or kidnapping committed aboard vessels or against persons at sea;
    c. hijacking vessels or aircraft for ransom or private purposes;
    d. operating pirate vessels or aircraft;
    e. facilitating, organizing, or financing piracy;
    f. attempting or conspiring to commit piracy; or
    g. any other unlawful acts of violence or depredation at sea for private ends.

3. Piracy is punished under Penalty Band E.

4. The penalty is aggravated where:
    a. the piracy results in death or serious injury;
    b. the piracy involves hostage-taking or prolonged detention;
    c. the piracy is systematic or part of organized criminal networks;
    d. the piracy involves substantial violence or cruelty;
    e. the piracy affects commercial shipping, humanitarian vessels, or vessels on important missions;
    f. the offender holds a leadership role in piracy operations; or
    g. the offender has previous convictions for piracy or maritime offences.

5. Armed robbery at sea committed in territorial waters or internal waters, not meeting the definition of piracy, is punished under Penalty Band D.

6. The following maritime offences are also punishable:
    a. unauthorized boarding or seizure of vessels (Penalty Band D);
    b. interference with navigation or safety of vessels (Penalty Band C, or Penalty Band D where endangering life);
    c. operating vessels for smuggling, trafficking, or other criminal purposes (Penalty Band D);
    d. illegal fishing in protected or exclusive economic zones on a commercial scale (Penalty Band C);
    e. marine pollution or dumping in violation of international maritime law (Penalty Band C, or Penalty Band D where causing severe environmental damage);
    f. failure to render assistance to vessels or persons in distress at sea (Penalty Band C); or
    g. operating unregistered, unseaworthy, or illegal vessels for commercial purposes (Penalty Band B).

7. The State shall exercise universal jurisdiction over piracy committed by any person anywhere on the high seas or in international waters.

8. The court may order confiscation of vessels, aircraft, and equipment used in piracy, and forfeiture of all proceeds.

9. This Article gives effect to Kaharagia's obligations under:
    a. the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS);
    b. the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation;
    c. customary international law on piracy; and
    d. other international maritime conventions.

10. Naval vessels, military aircraft, and government vessels on official service are not subject to this Article when acting under lawful authority.

11. Persons who engage in piracy or armed robbery at sea under coercion or duress may raise such circumstances in mitigation, but coercion is not a complete defence where the person voluntarily participated in violent acts.
