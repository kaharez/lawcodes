# Article 3 – Incitement and Glorification of Terrorism

1. It is an offence to incite, encourage, advocate, or glorify terrorism or terrorist acts, or to disseminate material for the purpose of promoting or encouraging terrorism.

2. Incitement and glorification of terrorism includes:
    (a) publicly inciting others to commit terrorist acts;
    (b) encouraging or advocating terrorism or violence for terrorist purposes;
    (c) glorifying, praising, or celebrating terrorist acts or terrorists;
    (d) disseminating propaganda, publications, or material promoting terrorism or terrorist organizations;
    (e) using social media, websites, or digital platforms to spread terrorist ideology or incite violence;
    (f) radicalizing or recruiting individuals for terrorist purposes;
    (g) providing instruction, training manuals, or guidance for committing terrorist acts;
    (h) operating platforms, websites, or channels for terrorist propaganda or recruitment; or
    (i) any other public communication intended to promote, encourage, or glorify terrorism.

3. Incitement and glorification of terrorism is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the incitement or glorification results in actual terrorist acts or recruitment;
    (b) the incitement or glorification is systematic, widespread, or targets vulnerable persons;
    (c) the incitement or glorification uses mass media, social media, or online platforms with wide reach;
    (d) the offender holds a position of religious, educational, or community leadership;
    (e) the incitement or glorification is part of organized terrorist propaganda networks;
    (f) the incitement or glorification specifically targets or endangers children or vulnerable persons; or
    (g) the offender has previous convictions for terrorism-related offences.

5. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "glorification" includes any form of praise, celebration, or positive portrayal that encourages emulation;
    (b) "incitement" requires intent to encourage or provoke terrorism, not mere expression of opinion or academic study;
    (c) the communication must be public or intended to reach the public; and
    (d) it is not necessary that any person actually be incited or that terrorist acts result.

6. It is a defence if:
    (a) the communication was made for legitimate journalistic, academic, artistic, or educational purposes without intent to incite or glorify terrorism;
    (b) the communication consisted of reporting, analysis, or criticism of terrorism without endorsement or encouragement;
    (c) the communication was made in the course of religious or political discourse that does not advocate violence or terrorism; or
    (d) the communication was historical or contextual discussion without glorification or incitement.

7. The court may order removal of terrorist content, closure of platforms or channels used for terrorist propaganda, and prohibition from operating media or communication platforms.

8. Internet service providers and platform operators have a duty to remove terrorist content expeditiously upon notification. Systematic failure to remove terrorist content may result in penalties under Penalty Band C and potential suspension of operations.

9. This Article must be applied consistently with freedom of expression, and only applies to content that genuinely incites, encourages, or glorifies terrorism, not to legitimate political speech, criticism, or academic discourse.
