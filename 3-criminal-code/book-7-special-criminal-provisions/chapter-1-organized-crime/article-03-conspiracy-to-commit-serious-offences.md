# Article 3 – Conspiracy to Commit Serious Offences

1. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a serious offence, accompanied by an act in furtherance of the agreement.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "serious offence" means any offence punishable under Penalty Band D or E;
    (b) "agreement" may be express or implied and need not be formal or in writing;
    (c) it is not necessary that all participants know all details of the plan or all other participants;
    (d) it is not necessary that the offence be completed or attempted, only that an agreement exists and an overt act is taken in furtherance; and
    (e) "overt act" includes any action taken to advance or prepare for the commission of the offence.

3. Conspiracy to commit offences punishable under Penalty Band E is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. Conspiracy to commit offences punishable under Penalty Band D is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty for conspiracy is aggravated where:
    (a) the conspiracy involves multiple participants or an organized structure;
    (b) the conspiracy is to commit particularly serious offences, including terrorism, trafficking, or grave violence;
    (c) the conspiracy is transnational or involves cross-border criminal activity;
    (d) substantial preparations or resources have been committed to the conspiracy;
    (e) the offender plays a leading or organizing role in the conspiracy; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for conspiracy or organized crime.

6. Where the substantive offence is actually committed or attempted, the offender may be charged with both conspiracy and the substantive offence, and penalties may be cumulated.

7. Withdrawal from conspiracy is a defence if:
    (a) the accused voluntarily and completely withdrew from the agreement;
    (b) the withdrawal occurred before any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy;
    (c) the accused took affirmative action to disavow or defeat the purpose of the conspiracy; or
    (d) the accused reported the conspiracy to authorities and cooperated fully.

8. Mere knowledge of a conspiracy without agreement to participate is not an offence under this Article, but may give rise to duties to report under other provisions.

9. This Article does not apply to conspiracies to commit offences punishable under Penalty Bands A, B, or C, except where specifically provided by law.
