# Article 1 – Participation in Criminal Organisation

1. A criminal organisation is a structured group of three or more persons, existing over a period of time, acting in concert to commit one or more serious offences, for the purpose of obtaining financial or other material benefit or achieving political or ideological objectives through criminal means.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "serious offence" means any offence punishable by Penalty Band D or E;
    (b) "structured group" means a group that is not randomly formed for the immediate commission of an offence and that does not need formal structure, defined roles, or continuity of membership; and
    (c) financial or material benefit includes money, property, services, or any other economic advantage.

3. The following acts constitute offences:
    (a) directing, organising, or leading a criminal organisation (Penalty Band E, with mandatory minimum penalties);
    (b) participating in a criminal organisation, including by providing support, resources, or services (Penalty Band E);
    (c) recruiting members for a criminal organisation (Penalty Band D);
    (d) financing or providing material support to a criminal organisation (Penalty Band D);
    (e) conspiring to participate in or support a criminal organisation (Penalty Band D); or
    (f) knowingly benefiting from the activities of a criminal organisation (Penalty Band C).

4. Participation in a criminal organisation is established where a person:
    (a) takes part in the organisation's criminal activities;
    (b) provides material support, resources, or services to the organisation with knowledge of its criminal nature;
    (c) recruits, induces, or facilitates others to join the organisation; or
    (d) otherwise knowingly contributes to the organisation's criminal objectives.

5. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the criminal organisation engages in particularly serious crimes, including trafficking, terrorism, corruption, or large-scale economic crimes;
    (b) the organisation operates transnationally or across multiple jurisdictions;
    (c) the organisation uses violence, intimidation, or corruption to achieve its objectives;
    (d) the organisation has infiltrated legitimate businesses, institutions, or government;
    (e) the offender holds a senior or leadership position in the organisation; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for participation in criminal organisations.

6. It is not necessary to prove that the person committed a specific offence in furtherance of the organisation's objectives, only that they participated in or supported the organisation knowing its criminal nature and objectives.

7. The court may order confiscation of all assets and property of the criminal organisation and its members derived from or used in criminal activities.

8. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered for leaders or senior members of criminal organisations engaged in grave criminal activity.
