    e. facilitating or organizing drug use events or gatherings;
    f. supplying drug paraphernalia for the purpose of facilitating unlawful drug use; or
    g. knowingly allowing property under one's control to be used for drug offences.

3. Operating or maintaining drug premises is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:

    f. the operation involves violence, coercion, or exploitation; or
    g. the offender has previous convictions for drug offences.

6. Supply of drug paraphernalia, including pipes, syringes, or equipment specifically designed for drug use, with knowledge or intent that it be used for unlawful drug consumption, is punished under Penalty Band B.

7. It is a defence if:
    a. the premises or facilities are operated for legitimate harm reduction, medical, or public health purposes, including supervised consumption sites or needle exchange programs authorized by law;
    b. the person did not know and had no reasonable grounds to suspect that the premises were being used for drug offences; or
