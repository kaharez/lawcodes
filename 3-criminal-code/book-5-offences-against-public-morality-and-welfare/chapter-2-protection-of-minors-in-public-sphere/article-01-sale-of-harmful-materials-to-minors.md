# Article 1 – Sale of Harmful Materials to Minors

1. It is an offence to knowingly sell, supply, distribute, or make available to a child materials that are harmful to minors.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    a. "child" means any person under the age of eighteen years;
    b. "harmful materials" include materials depicting explicit sexual content, extreme violence, or content that is otherwise inappropriate for minors and likely to cause harm to their development or wellbeing; and
    c. materials include printed materials, digital content, videos, games, or any other media.

3. Sale of harmful materials to minors is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the materials depict content that would constitute child sexual abuse material or sexual exploitation;
    b. the sale or distribution is systematic or commercial;
    c. the offender deliberately targets children or operates in locations frequented by children;
    d. the materials are distributed online without age verification measures; or
    e. the offender has previous convictions for offences involving minors.

5. It is a defence if the accused took reasonable steps to verify the age of the recipient and had reasonable grounds to believe the recipient was of or above the age of eighteen years.

6. This Article does not apply to materials provided for legitimate educational, medical, artistic, or scientific purposes in appropriate contexts.

7. Commercial operators and platforms have a duty to implement effective age verification and content restriction measures for materials harmful to minors. Systematic failure to implement such measures is punishable under Penalty Band C.
