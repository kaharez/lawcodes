# Article 2 – Sale of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Restricted Substances to Minors

1. It is an offence to sell, supply, give, or make available alcohol, tobacco products, nicotine products, or other age-restricted substances to a person under the age of eighteen years.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "alcohol" includes all beverages containing ethanol intended for human consumption;
    (b) "tobacco products" includes cigarettes, cigars, tobacco for smoking, chewing tobacco, and all tobacco-based products;
    (c) "nicotine products" includes electronic cigarettes, vaping devices, and nicotine-containing liquids or products; and
    (d) "restricted substances" includes any substance designated as prohibited for sale to minors by law or regulation.

3. Sale, supply, or provision to minors is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the sale or supply is systematic or commercial;
    (b) the seller operates a business without implementing age verification measures;
    (c) the seller deliberately targets minors or sells in locations frequented by children;
    (d) the sale or supply involves substantial quantities or particularly harmful products;
    (e) the seller has previous convictions for selling restricted products to minors; or
    (f) the sale or supply results in harm to the minor.

5. It is a defence if the accused took all reasonable steps to verify the age of the purchaser and had reasonable grounds to believe the purchaser was of or above the age of eighteen years, including by checking identification documents.

6. Commercial operators have a duty to implement and maintain effective age verification systems and to train employees in age restriction requirements. Systematic failure to implement such measures is punishable under Penalty Band B.

7. Providing alcohol or tobacco to one's own children in private family contexts in accordance with cultural or religious practices is not an offence under this Article, provided no harm results to the child.

8. The court may order confiscation of products, suspension or revocation of business licenses, and prohibition from selling age-restricted products.
