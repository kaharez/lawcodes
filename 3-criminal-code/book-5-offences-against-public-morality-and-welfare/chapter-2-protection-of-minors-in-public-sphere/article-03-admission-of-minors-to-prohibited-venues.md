# Article 3 – Admission of Minors to Prohibited Venues

1. It is an offence to knowingly permit or admit a person under the age of eighteen years to enter or remain in venues, establishments, or events designated as prohibited or restricted for minors.

2. Prohibited venues for minors include:
    (a) gambling establishments, casinos, and gaming venues;
    (b) adult entertainment venues, including establishments offering sexual services or adult performances;
    (c) venues serving alcohol where minors are prohibited by law or license conditions;
    (d) events or venues featuring content inappropriate for minors, including violent or sexually explicit performances; or
    (e) any other venue or event designated by law or regulation as prohibited for minors.

3. Knowingly admitting or permitting minors to enter prohibited venues is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the venue or event exposes minors to sexual exploitation, gambling, or particularly harmful content;
    (b) the admission of minors is systematic or part of business operations;
    (c) the minor suffers harm, exploitation, or adverse consequences;
    (d) the operator deliberately admits minors without age verification;
    (e) the venue involves illegal activities, including prostitution or illegal gambling; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for offences involving minors.

5. It is a defence if:
    (a) the accused took all reasonable steps to verify the age of persons entering and had reasonable grounds to believe all persons were of or above the age of eighteen years;
    (b) the minor entered or remained without the knowledge of the operator or staff despite reasonable security and age verification measures; or
    (c) the minor was accompanied by a parent or legal guardian in circumstances where parental accompaniment is permitted by law or regulation.

6. Venue operators have a duty to implement and maintain effective age verification systems, post clear age restriction notices, and train staff in enforcement of age restrictions. Systematic failure to implement such measures is punishable under Penalty Band B.

7. The court may order suspension or revocation of licenses, prohibition from operating venues or businesses serving minors, and payment of fines.

8. Parents or guardians who deliberately bring minors to prohibited venues or facilitate minors' access to such venues may be prosecuted under this Article.
