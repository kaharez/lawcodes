1. It is an offence to produce, manufacture, sell, distribute, or supply food, beverages, medicines, cosmetics, or other products for human use that are unsafe, adulterated, contaminated, or unfit for their intended purpose.

2. Food and product safety offences include:
    (a) selling or supplying food or beverages that are contaminated, spoiled, adulterated, or unsafe for consumption;
    (b) manufacturing or selling medicines, supplements, or medical products that are counterfeit, substandard, or falsely labeled;
    (c) failing to comply with food safety standards, hygiene requirements, or product safety regulations;
    (d) misrepresenting the contents, quality, or safety of food or products;
    (e) failing to warn consumers of known risks or hazards associated with products;
    (f) selling expired, recalled, or banned products;
    (g) falsely labeling products as organic, natural, or meeting quality standards;
    (h) operating food production, processing, or service facilities in violation of health and safety requirements; or
    (i) any other conduct creating risk to consumers through unsafe products.

3. Food and product safety offences are punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the unsafe products cause illness, injury, or death;
    (b) the unsafe products affect a large number of persons or are distributed widely;
    (c) the offence is committed deliberately or with gross negligence;
    (d) the offence involves vulnerable persons, including children, elderly persons, or persons with medical conditions;
    (e) the offence is systematic or committed for commercial profit;
    (f) the offence involves counterfeit medicines or products critical to health;
    (g) the offender holds a professional position of responsibility for food or product safety; or
    (h) the offender has previous convictions for safety offences.

5. Where food or product safety offences result in death, the offence may also constitute manslaughter under Book 3, Chapter 1, with the safety violation as an aggravating circumstance.

6. Juridical persons may be held liable for food and product safety offences committed in the course of their operations.

7. The court may order product recalls, destruction of unsafe products, confiscation of proceeds, prohibition from operating food or product businesses, and publication of judgments to warn consumers.

8. Whistleblowers and persons who report safety violations in good faith shall be protected from retaliation and shall not be prosecuted for possession or handling of unsafe products discovered in the course of their legitimate duties.
