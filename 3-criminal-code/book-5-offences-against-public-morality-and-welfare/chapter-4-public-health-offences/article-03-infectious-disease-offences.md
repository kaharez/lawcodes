# Article 3 – Infectious Disease Offences

1. It is an offence to knowingly or recklessly transmit infectious diseases to others, or to violate public health measures designed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

2. Infectious disease offences include:
    a. knowingly exposing others to serious infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections, without disclosure or consent;
    b. deliberately transmitting infectious diseases to others;
    c. violating quarantine, isolation, or public health orders;
    d. failing to comply with mandatory testing, treatment, or notification requirements for infectious diseases;
    e. concealing infection status from sexual partners, medical professionals, or persons at risk;
    f. operating businesses or facilities in violation of public health emergency measures;
    g. refusing vaccination or prophylaxis where legally mandated for public health protection; or
    h. any other conduct that knowingly or recklessly creates risk of disease transmission in violation of public health laws.

3. Knowingly transmitting serious infectious diseases is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    a. the transmission is deliberate with intent to harm;
    b. the disease transmitted is life-threatening or causes permanent injury;
    c. multiple persons are infected;
    d. the transmission affects vulnerable persons, including children, elderly persons, or immunocompromised individuals;
    e. the offender holds a professional position of trust or responsibility for public health;
    f. the transmission occurs in healthcare, educational, or care settings; or
    g. the offender has previous convictions for infectious disease offences.

5. Violation of quarantine or isolation orders is punished under Penalty Band B, or Penalty Band C where the violation results in transmission of disease or creates substantial public health risk.

6. Failure to disclose infection status to sexual partners where there is a risk of transmission of serious sexually transmitted infections is punished under Penalty Band C.

7. It is a defence if:
    a. the accused took all reasonable precautions to prevent transmission, including disclosure, use of protective measures, and adherence to medical advice;
    b. the person exposed to infection gave informed consent after full disclosure of risks;
    c. the accused was unaware of their infection status and had no reason to suspect infection; or
    d. the violation of public health measures was necessary to prevent immediate danger and was reasonable in the circumstances.

8. Public health authorities may impose civil quarantine or isolation measures, which shall be subject to judicial review, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Deliberate violation of such lawfully imposed measures is subject to the penalties under this Article.

9. This Article does not apply to ordinary negligence in disease prevention, but only to knowing or reckless conduct that creates substantial risk of transmission.
