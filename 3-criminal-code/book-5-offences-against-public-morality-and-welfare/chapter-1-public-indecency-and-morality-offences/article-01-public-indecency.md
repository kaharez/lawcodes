# Article 1 – Public Indecency

1. Public indecency is the intentional exposure of one's body or engagement in sexual conduct in a public place or in circumstances where the conduct is visible to the public, in a manner that causes offence, alarm, or distress.

2. Public indecency includes:
    (a) indecent exposure of genitals, breasts, or buttocks in public;
    (b) engaging in sexual activity in public or in view of the public;
    (c) public urination or defecation in places other than designated facilities, where such conduct causes offence or distress;
    (d) lewd or obscene gestures or conduct in public; or
    (e) any other indecent conduct that violates public decency or morality.

3. Public indecency is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    (a) the indecent conduct is committed in the presence of children;
    (b) the indecent conduct is repeated or persistent;
    (c) the indecent conduct is committed for the purpose of sexual gratification or to cause alarm;
    (d) the indecent conduct occurs in places where children are likely to be present, including schools, playgrounds, or family venues; or
    (e) the offender has previous convictions for public indecency.

5. It is a defence if the conduct occurred in circumstances where privacy could reasonably be expected and the exposure or conduct was inadvertent or accidental.

6. This Article does not apply to lawful artistic, theatrical, or cultural performances, or to conduct occurring in designated spaces where such conduct is expected and lawful.
