# Article 3 – Obscene Materials and Public Display

1. It is an offence to publicly display, distribute, or broadcast obscene materials in circumstances where such materials are likely to be seen by persons who have not consented to view them, or by children.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    a. "obscene materials" means materials depicting explicit sexual acts, extreme violence, or content that violates standards of public decency, without artistic, educational, or scientific value;
    b. "public display" includes display in public places, shop windows, billboards, vehicles, or online platforms accessible to the general public without age restrictions; and
    c. "distribution" includes selling, offering, lending, or making available to the public.

3. Public display or distribution of obscene materials is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    a. the materials depict content involving children or particularly degrading or violent content;
    b. the display or distribution is systematic or commercial;
    c. the display occurs in locations frequented by children or families;
    d. the distribution is to children or without effective age verification;
    e. the materials are displayed or distributed widely or through mass media; or
    f. the offender has previous convictions for morality offences.

5. It is a defence if:
    a. the materials have recognized artistic, literary, scientific, or educational value;
    b. the display or distribution occurred in designated adult venues with appropriate age restrictions and content warnings;
    c. the distribution was to adults who requested the materials and effective age verification was conducted; or
    d. the materials were displayed or distributed in professional, academic, or medical contexts for legitimate purposes.

6. This Article does not apply to materials that merely depict nudity or sexual content with artistic or educational purpose, provided they are not obscene and are displayed or distributed with appropriate age restrictions.

7. The court may order confiscation and destruction of obscene materials.
