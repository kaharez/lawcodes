    b. masturbation in public or in view of the public;
    c. engaging in sexual activity in vehicles where visible to the public;
    d. engaging in sexual activity in semi-public spaces, including restrooms, changing rooms, or transportation, where others may be present; or
    e. deliberate exhibition of sexual conduct for the purpose of shocking, alarming, or causing offence.

3. Public sexual conduct is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the conduct occurs in the presence of children or where children are likely to witness it;
    b. the conduct occurs in places specifically frequented by families or children;
    c. the conduct is performed for commercial purposes or broadcast publicly;
    d. the conduct involves multiple persons or is organized;
    e. the conduct is persistent or repeated despite warnings; or
