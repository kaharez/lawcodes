# Article 3 – Abandonment of Animals

1. Abandonment of animals is the act of deserting, leaving, or disposing of an animal in circumstances where the animal is deprived of proper care and is likely to suffer harm or distress.

2. Abandonment of animals includes:
    (a) deserting or leaving an animal in any place without making adequate arrangements for its care;
    (b) releasing domestic or captive animals into the wild or unfamiliar environments where they are unable to survive or care for themselves;
    (c) leaving animals confined or tethered without provision for food, water, or care;
    (d) disposing of animals by leaving them in dangerous or unsuitable locations;
    (e) failing to reclaim animals from boarding, veterinary care, or temporary keeping after a reasonable period; or
    (f) any other act that constitutes desertion of an animal without adequate provision for its welfare.

3. Abandonment of animals is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    (a) the abandonment results in serious suffering, injury, or death of the animal;
    (b) the abandonment involves multiple animals;
    (c) the abandonment involves particularly vulnerable animals, including young, elderly, pregnant, sick, or disabled animals;
    (d) the animal was abandoned in dangerous conditions or locations where death or injury was likely;
    (e) the abandonment was committed to evade responsibility for the animal's care or medical treatment;
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for abandonment or animal welfare offences; or
    (g) the abandonment is part of systematic or commercial animal-related activity.

5. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the accused believed the animal could survive on its own;
    (b) the accused left the animal near a residence, shelter, or facility in the hope it would be found;
    (c) the accused could no longer afford to care for the animal; or
    (d) the animal was unwanted or no longer useful.

6. It is a defence that:
    (a) the accused made reasonable and adequate arrangements for the animal's care before relinquishing it;
    (b) the accused surrendered the animal to an appropriate shelter, rescue organisation, or capable person willing to care for it;
    (c) the accused was forced to leave the animal due to immediate emergency circumstances beyond their control and took all reasonable steps to ensure its safety and recovery; or
    (d) the release of a wild animal was carried out under proper supervision and in accordance with wildlife rehabilitation or conservation protocols.

7. Owners who are unable or unwilling to continue caring for an animal have a legal obligation to:
    (a) surrender the animal to an appropriate animal shelter, rescue organisation, or sanctuary;
    (b) transfer the animal to a responsible and capable person willing to provide care;
    (c) seek assistance from animal welfare organisations or authorities; or
    (d) take any other reasonable step to ensure the animal's welfare.

8. The court may order:
    (a) permanent prohibition from owning or keeping animals;
    (b) payment of costs for rescue, treatment, and care of abandoned animals;
    (c) compensation to organisations or persons who provided care for the animal; or
    (d) any other measure appropriate to the circumstances.

9. Animal shelters, rescue organisations, and persons who take in abandoned animals are not liable for offences related to the abandonment, and have the right to seek recovery of costs from the person who abandoned the animal.
