# Article 8 – Illegal Veterinary Practices

1. Illegal veterinary practices are the performance of veterinary procedures, surgeries, or treatments by persons who are not qualified or licensed, or the performance of such procedures in breach of professional regulations, standards, or restrictions.

2. Illegal veterinary practices include:
    (a) performing surgery or invasive procedures on animals without holding a valid veterinary licence or qualification;
    (b) diagnosing, treating, or prescribing medication for animal diseases or conditions without proper veterinary qualification;
    (c) holding oneself out as a veterinarian or veterinary professional without proper credentials;
    (d) performing veterinary procedures while suspended, disqualified, or prohibited from practice;
    (e) performing procedures outside the scope of one's qualification or licence;
    (f) performing procedures without adequate facilities, equipment, anaesthesia, or sterile conditions;
    (g) performing procedures in violation of professional standards, ethical guidelines, or regulations;
    (h) delegating veterinary procedures to unqualified persons; or
    (i) any other practice of veterinary medicine in violation of licensing requirements or professional regulations.

3. Illegal veterinary practices are punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the illegal practice results in serious injury, suffering, permanent disability, or death of an animal;
    (b) the illegal practice is performed systematically or as part of commercial activity;
    (c) the illegal practice involves particularly risky or complex procedures;
    (d) the illegal practice is performed without proper anaesthesia, sterile conditions, or pain management;
    (e) the illegal practice affects multiple animals;
    (f) the person fraudulently represented themselves as qualified;
    (g) the illegal practice was motivated by financial gain;
    (h) the offender has previous convictions for illegal practice or animal welfare offences; or
    (i) the illegal practice involves prohibited mutilations or other unlawful procedures.

5. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the procedure was successful or the animal recovered;
    (b) the person had experience or informal training;
    (c) the animal's owner consented to the procedure;
    (d) the procedure was less expensive than professional veterinary care;
    (e) the procedure was performed for charitable or non-commercial purposes; or
    (f) the person acted in good faith.

6. It is a defence that:
    (a) the person acted in an emergency to save the animal's life or prevent immediate serious suffering, and it was not reasonably possible to obtain professional veterinary care in time;
    (b) the person performed basic first aid or care that does not constitute veterinary practice;
    (c) the person is a qualified veterinary technician, nurse, or assistant performing procedures within the scope of their qualification and under appropriate supervision; or
    (d) the person is engaged in lawful agricultural practices that do not constitute veterinary medicine, such as basic animal husbandry procedures performed in accordance with accepted standards.

7. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "veterinary practice" includes diagnosis, treatment, surgery, prescription of medication, and any other procedure requiring professional veterinary knowledge and skill;
    (b) basic animal care, grooming, training, and husbandry that do not involve medical treatment or invasive procedures are not veterinary practice;
    (c) qualification requirements and scope of practice are determined by professional regulations and licensing authorities; and
    (d) professional standards and ethical guidelines are established by veterinary regulatory bodies and may be updated by regulation.

8. The court may order:
    (a) permanent prohibition from performing any animal-related procedures or practices;
    (b) prohibition from owning or working with animals;
    (c) payment of veterinary costs for treatment of animals harmed;
    (d) compensatory damages to animal owners;
    (e) professional sanctions and referral to regulatory authorities; or
    (f) any other appropriate remedy.

9. Veterinarians and veterinary professionals who aid, abet, or facilitate illegal practice by unqualified persons may be subject to professional disciplinary proceedings and criminal liability as accomplices.

10. This Article does not prohibit:
    (a) emergency first aid by any person in urgent circumstances;
    (b) basic care and husbandry by owners and keepers within the scope of normal animal care;
    (c) procedures performed by qualified veterinary technicians, nurses, or assistants within their authorised scope of practice;
    (d) research and teaching activities conducted under proper supervision and in accordance with applicable regulations; or
