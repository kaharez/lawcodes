# Article 9 – Duty to Report Serious Mistreatment

1. Veterinarians and other regulated professionals who, in the course of their professional duties, observe or have reasonable grounds to believe that an animal is subject to grave or sustained mistreatment, have a duty to report the matter to the competent authorities.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "grave mistreatment" means cruelty, abuse, or neglect that causes or is likely to cause serious suffering, injury, permanent disability, or death;
    (b) "sustained mistreatment" means ongoing, repeated, or systematic cruelty, abuse, or neglect;
    (c) "regulated professionals" includes veterinarians, veterinary technicians and nurses, animal welfare officers, persons licensed to operate animal facilities, and any other professionals designated by regulation as having reporting obligations; and
    (d) "competent authorities" includes animal welfare enforcement agencies, police, and any other authorities designated to receive and investigate reports of animal mistreatment.

3. The duty to report arises where the professional:
    (a) directly observes grave or sustained mistreatment;
    (b) observes physical evidence of grave or sustained mistreatment, including severe injuries, malnutrition, or signs of systematic abuse;
    (c) has reasonable grounds to believe, based on professional knowledge and observations, that grave or sustained mistreatment is occurring or has occurred; or
    (d) becomes aware through professional consultations or examinations that an animal has been subjected to prohibited mutilations, illegal procedures, or other serious mistreatment.

4. Failure to report grave or sustained mistreatment by a person under a legal duty to do so is punished under Penalty Band B.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    (a) the failure to report is wilful or deliberate;
    (b) the failure to report is motivated by personal or financial interest;
    (c) the mistreatment continues or worsens as a result of the failure to report;
    (d) the failure to report is part of a pattern of concealing animal mistreatment;
    (e) the professional actively conceals or destroys evidence of mistreatment; or
    (f) the offender has previous disciplinary or criminal history related to animal welfare.

6. It is not a breach of professional confidentiality or client privilege to report grave or sustained animal mistreatment as required by this Article, and such reporting is expressly authorised and required by law.

7. Professionals who make reports in good faith and with reasonable grounds are:
    (a) protected from civil liability arising from the report;
    (b) protected from professional disciplinary action for breach of confidentiality;
    (c) protected from retaliation by clients or employers; and
    (d) not subject to criminal liability for the report, even if the report does not result in prosecution or is found to be unsubstantiated, provided it was made in good faith.

8. Reports should be made:
    (a) as soon as reasonably practicable after the mistreatment is observed or suspected;
    (b) to the appropriate competent authority designated to receive such reports;
    (c) with sufficient detail to allow authorities to investigate and take appropriate action; and
    (d) in accordance with any reporting protocols or procedures established by regulation.

9. The duty to report does not require:
    (a) absolute certainty that mistreatment has occurred, only reasonable grounds to believe it;
    (b) the professional to conduct their own investigation beyond their normal professional duties;
    (c) disclosure of information beyond what is necessary to alert authorities to the suspected mistreatment; or
    (d) the professional to make repeated reports of the same matter if already reported, unless new information arises.

10. Minor instances of inadequate care, negligence, or welfare concerns that do not rise to the level of grave or sustained mistreatment may be addressed through:
    (a) professional advice and education to the animal owner;
    (b) referral to animal welfare organisations or support services;
    (c) follow-up and monitoring within the professional relationship; or
    (d) voluntary reporting to authorities if the professional believes intervention is warranted.

11. Competent authorities shall:
    (a) receive and investigate reports of animal mistreatment promptly and thoroughly;
    (b) maintain confidentiality of reporting professionals where appropriate;
    (c) take appropriate enforcement action where mistreatment is substantiated;
    (d) provide feedback to reporting professionals on the outcome of investigations where feasible; and
    (e) establish accessible reporting mechanisms and clear procedures.

12. Professional regulatory bodies may establish additional guidance, protocols, and standards regarding the duty to report animal mistreatment, provided such guidance is consistent with this Article and applicable law.

13. Employers and facilities shall not:
    (a) retaliate against professionals for making good faith reports;
    (b) obstruct or discourage professionals from fulfilling their reporting obligations;
    (c) require professionals to seek permission before reporting; or
    (d) impose any penalty, disadvantage, or adverse consequence for lawful reporting.

14. Where a professional fails to report and is subsequently subject to criminal or disciplinary proceedings under this Article, evidence that they were prevented, discouraged, or pressured by employers or others not to report may be considered in mitigation.
