# Article 4 – Prohibited Mutilations of Companion and Pet Animals

1. This Article addresses prohibited mutilations of companion animals, pet animals, and animals kept for non-agricultural purposes. For mutilations of agricultural animals, see Article 5 of this Chapter.

2. Prohibited mutilations are surgical procedures, alterations, or modifications to an animal's body that cause pain, suffering, or permanent alteration without legitimate medical necessity, or that are specifically prohibited by law or Sovereign Decree.

3. The following procedures are prohibited unless performed by a qualified veterinarian for therapeutic medical necessity to protect the health or welfare of the animal:
    (a) feline declawing (onychectomy or tendonectomy);
    (b) canine debarking (devocalisation);
    (c) cosmetic procedures performed solely for aesthetic purposes without medical benefit to the animal;
    (d) tail docking, ear cropping, or other cosmetic mutilations, except where permitted by regulation for specific working animals or breeds with established medical justification;
    (e) defanging, removal of claws or teeth for non-medical purposes;
    (f) any surgical procedure performed without adequate anaesthesia or pain management; or
    (g) any other procedure designated as prohibited by Sovereign Decree No. 2023/0004 or subsequent regulations.

4. Performing or procuring a prohibited mutilation is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the prohibited mutilation is performed by a person holding a veterinary or professional qualification, constituting professional misconduct;
    (b) the prohibited mutilation is performed without anaesthesia or proper pain management;
    (c) the prohibited mutilation results in serious complications, infection, permanent disability, or death;
    (d) the prohibited mutilation is performed on multiple animals;
    (e) the prohibited mutilation is performed for commercial purposes or as part of systematic practice;
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for prohibited mutilations or animal cruelty; or
    (g) the prohibited mutilation involves particularly cruel or inhumane methods.

6. It is a defence that:
    (a) the procedure was performed by a qualified veterinarian and was medically necessary to treat injury, disease, or medical condition, or to prevent imminent serious health risk to the animal;
    (b) the procedure was performed in accordance with accepted veterinary standards and with appropriate anaesthesia, pain management, and post-operative care;
    (c) the procedure was specifically authorised by law or regulation for the particular species and purpose; or
    (d) the procedure was performed in an emergency to save the animal's life or prevent immediate suffering.

7. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "therapeutic medical necessity" means a procedure required to treat or prevent a specific medical condition, injury, or disease affecting the individual animal's health or welfare;
    (b) cosmetic or convenience procedures that provide no medical benefit to the animal do not constitute therapeutic necessity;
    (c) routine procedures such as neutering, spaying, microchipping, and necessary hoof care, when performed by qualified persons with appropriate anaesthesia and care, are not prohibited mutilations; and
    (d) The Sovereign may, by Sovereign Decree, establish lists of prohibited procedures and exceptions for specific purposes.

8. Veterinarians who perform prohibited mutilations are subject to:
    (a) criminal penalties under this Article;
    (b) professional disciplinary proceedings and potential loss of licence to practice;
    (c) civil liability for harm caused to animals and their owners; and
    (d) prohibition from veterinary practice.

9. Persons who procure, request, or pressure veterinarians or others to perform prohibited mutilations are equally guilty of the offence.

10. The court may order:
    (a) permanent disqualification from veterinary or animal-related professions;
    (b) prohibition from owning or keeping animals;
    (c) payment of veterinary costs for treatment of complications;
    (d) compensatory damages; or
    (e) any other appropriate remedy.
