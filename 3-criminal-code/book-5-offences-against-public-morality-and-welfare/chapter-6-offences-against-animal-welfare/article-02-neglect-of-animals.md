# Article 2 – Neglect of Animals

1. Neglect of animals is the failure by an owner, keeper, or person responsible for an animal to provide the animal with adequate care, resulting in suffering, harm, or substantial risk of harm to the animal.

2. Neglect of animals includes:
    a. failure to provide adequate food or clean water, resulting in starvation, malnutrition, or dehydration;
    b. failure to provide appropriate shelter, housing, or protection from weather, resulting in exposure, hypothermia, heat stress, or injury;
    c. failure to provide necessary veterinary care or medical treatment for illness, injury, or disease;
    d. failure to provide adequate space, exercise, or stimulation appropriate to the animal's needs, resulting in physical or psychological suffering;
    e. keeping animals in unsanitary, hazardous, or inhumane conditions;
    f. confining animals in spaces that are too small, inadequate, or cause injury or distress;
    g. failure to protect animals from abuse, attack, or harm by other animals or persons;
    h. hoarding or keeping excessive numbers of animals without adequate resources to care for them; or
    i. any other failure to fulfil the duty of care imposed by the Civil Code, Book III, Chapter 8.

3. Neglect of animals is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    a. the neglect is severe, prolonged, or systematic;
    b. the neglect results in serious injury, permanent disability, or death of the animal;
    c. the neglect affects multiple animals;
    d. the neglect continues despite warnings or intervention by authorities;
    e. the offender is engaged in commercial animal-related activities;
    f. the offender holds a professional position of responsibility over animals;
    g. the offender has previous convictions for animal neglect or cruelty; or
    h. the neglect involves particularly vulnerable animals, including young, elderly, pregnant, or disabled animals.

5. It is a defence that:
    a. the accused lacked the means to provide care despite reasonable efforts and took appropriate steps to seek assistance or rehome the animal;
    b. the accused was prevented from providing care by circumstances beyond their control and took all reasonable steps to ensure the animal's welfare; or
    c. the neglect was minor, inadvertent, and immediately corrected upon discovery.

6. Where an animal is found to be suffering from neglect, competent authorities may:
    a. issue orders requiring immediate provision of care, treatment, or improvement of conditions;
    b. remove the animal and place it in appropriate care, with costs recoverable from the owner;
    c. prohibit the owner from keeping animals, either temporarily or permanently; or
    d. take any other action necessary to protect the animal's welfare.

7. The court may order:
    a. confiscation of animals and transfer to appropriate care;
    b. prohibition from owning or keeping animals;
    c. payment of costs for veterinary treatment and care of animals;
    d. supervision and monitoring of animal keeping; or
    e. any other measure necessary to prevent future neglect.

8. Animal hoarding, defined as keeping an excessive number of animals in conditions where the keeper cannot provide adequate care, resulting in severe neglect and suffering, is an aggravated form of neglect punishable under Penalty Band C, and may also indicate need for mental health intervention.
