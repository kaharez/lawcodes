# Article 1 – Legitimate Defence

1. An act does not constitute an offence where it is committed in legitimate defence, that is, in order to repel an unjust and imminent attack upon one’s person, rights, or property, or upon the person, rights, or property of another.

2. Defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the nature of the attack.

3. A defensive act remains justified even if it causes injury to the aggressor, provided the harm was not manifestly excessive in relation to the danger faced.

4. Where a person reasonably, but mistakenly, believes that an attack is imminent, legitimate defence shall apply if the belief was grounded in the circumstances.
