# Article 2 – State of Necessity

1. An act does not constitute an offence where it is committed in a state of necessity, that is, to avert a grave and imminent harm that could not otherwise be avoided.

2. The harm caused must not be manifestly disproportionate to the harm avoided.

3. State of necessity shall not apply where the person has, by prior conduct, intentionally created the conditions of necessity.

4. Economic hardship alone does not constitute a state of necessity unless it threatens fundamental rights or safety.
