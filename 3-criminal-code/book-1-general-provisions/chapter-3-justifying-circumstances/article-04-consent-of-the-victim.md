# Article 4 – Consent of the Victim

1. An act does not constitute an offence where it is carried out with the lawful consent of the victim, where the protected interest permits consent.

2. Consent is invalid where given by a person lacking legal capacity, where obtained through coercion, deception, or fraud, or where prohibited by law.

3. Consent may be withdrawn at any time prior to the act; continued conduct after withdrawal is unlawful.
