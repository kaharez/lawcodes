# Article 4 – Rehearing upon Appearance

1. A person convicted in absence shall be entitled to request a rehearing upon demonstrating:
    (a) that they were not effectively notified; or
    (b) that their absence was due to circumstances beyond their control.

2. Upon granting a rehearing, the prior judgment shall be set aside, and the case shall proceed as though no trial had taken place.

3. The right to rehearing does not apply where the accused deliberately evaded justice or expressly declined to participate despite proper notification.

4. A rehearing shall not prejudice any civil rights acquired by third parties in good faith.
