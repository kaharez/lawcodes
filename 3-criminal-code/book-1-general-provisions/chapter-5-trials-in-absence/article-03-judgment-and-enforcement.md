# Article 3 – Judgment and Enforcement

1. A judgment rendered in absence shall have full legal effect and may impose any penalty authorised by this Code, including fines, restitution, disqualification, and orders for publication.

2. Penalties that require the physical presence of the accused or foreign cooperation, including custodial penalties, may be enforced only when the accused comes within the jurisdiction of the State or through recognised international mechanisms.

3. Non-custodial penalties, including fines, digital sanctions, and status-related penalties, shall take effect immediately upon the issuance of the judgment unless otherwise ordered.
