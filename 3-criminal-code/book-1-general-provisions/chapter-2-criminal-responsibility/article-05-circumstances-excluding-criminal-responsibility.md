# Article 5 – Circumstances Excluding Criminal Responsibility

1. No offence is committed where the act is justified by:
    (a) legitimate defence, where the act was necessary to repel an unjust and imminent attack;
    (b) state of necessity, where the act was necessary to prevent a grave and imminent harm;
    (c) execution of a lawful order, issued by competent authority;
    (d) consent of the victim, where the protected interest permits lawful consent.

2. A person who acts under an unavoidable mistake of fact that negates intent shall not be held criminally responsible.

3. A mistake of law shall not excuse criminal responsibility unless the person reasonably relied on an official statement or decision of a competent authority.
