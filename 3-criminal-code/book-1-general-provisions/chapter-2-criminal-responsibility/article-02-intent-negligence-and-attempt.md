1. Intent is present where the accused acts with the purpose of causing the prohibited result or with knowledge that it will occur.

2. Negligence is present where the accused fails to exercise the care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same circumstances, resulting in the prohibited outcome.

3. An attempt occurs where a person, with intent to commit an offence, begins to carry out its execution but does not complete it.

4. An attempt is punishable where expressly provided by this Code or where the nature of the offence so requires.

5. Voluntary and complete renunciation before the commission of the offence may be considered in mitigation.
