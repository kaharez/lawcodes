# Article 1 – Individual Criminal Responsibility

1. A person is criminally responsible only for acts or omissions committed with intent or negligence as defined in this Chapter.

2. Criminal responsibility is personal; no one shall be held liable for the act of another unless this Code expressly provides for participation or complicity.

3. No person shall be convicted unless their guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.

4. A person who is not capable of forming criminal intent due to mental incapacity at the time of the act shall not be held criminally responsible, without prejudice to protective measures authorised by law.

5. A person under the age of ten years is conclusively presumed to be incapable of forming criminal intent and shall not be subject to criminal prosecution. Protective, educational, or welfare measures may be applied through civil or administrative proceedings.

6. A person who has attained the age of ten years but has not attained the age of fourteen years is rebuttably presumed to lack criminal capacity. Such a person may be held criminally responsible only if the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the child understood the nature and wrongfulness of their conduct at the time of the offence.

7. Persons under the age of eighteen years who are subject to criminal proceedings shall be afforded special protections and procedures appropriate to their age, maturity, and circumstances, including:
    a. proceedings conducted separately from adult offenders;
    b. priority given to rehabilitation, education, and reintegration over punishment;
    c. consideration of the child's best interests in all decisions;
    d. penalties proportionate to the child's age, maturity, and circumstances; and
    e. confidentiality and protection of identity in accordance with law.
