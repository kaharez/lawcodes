# Article 5 – Sovereign Denationalisation

1. The Sovereign may, in the exercise of the Sovereign prerogative, order the loss of nationality of a person convicted of an offence that gravely endangers the security, dignity, or essential interests of the State.

2. Loss of nationality shall take effect only through a Sovereign Decree, issued upon:
    a. recommendation of the High Court; or
    b. the Sovereign’s own motion, having regard to the gravity of the offence and the protection of the national community.

3. The court may recommend loss of nationality in its judgment, but such recommendation shall not bind the Sovereign.

4. Loss of nationality has the effect of terminating all nationality rights, Verified Kaharagian Status, honours, commissions, and registrations within the State. Loss of nationality automatically effects deprivation of all civil rights under Civil Code, Book I, Chapter 3, Article 5, without need for separate decree of deprivation.

5. The Sovereign may restore nationality by decree.

6. The decision to remove nationality shall not be subject to judicial appeal.
