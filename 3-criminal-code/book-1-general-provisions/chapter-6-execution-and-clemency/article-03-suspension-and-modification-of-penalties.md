    (a) the convicted person demonstrates sincere remorse;
    (b) restitution has been made; or
    (c) suspension is necessary to prevent undue hardship.

2. The court may modify a penalty upon:
    (a) material change in circumstances;
    (b) discovery of new evidence relevant to sentencing;
    (c) agreement of the parties in restorative justice processes approved by the court.
