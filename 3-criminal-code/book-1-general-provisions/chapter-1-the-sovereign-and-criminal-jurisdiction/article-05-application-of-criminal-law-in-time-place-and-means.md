# Article 5 – Application of Criminal Law in Time, Place, and Means

1. Criminal statutes apply only to acts committed after their entry into force unless a law expressly provides otherwise.

2. Where an offence is continuous in nature, it shall be deemed committed so long as its effects persist upon persons or institutions of the State.

3. An offence committed partly within and partly outside the State shall be deemed committed within the State if any substantial element affects persons, systems, or interests under Kaharagian protection.

4. Acts committed through digital systems, automated processes, or remote electronic means fall within the scope of this Code in the same manner as physical acts.

5. In case of doubt, provisions governing criminal liability shall be interpreted strictly and in favour of the accused, without prejudice to the General Principles of Law.
