# Article 4 – Classification of Offences

1. Offences under this Code are classified as:
    (a) Crimes, being the most serious offences;
    (b) Delicts, being ordinary criminal offences; and
    (c) Infractions, being minor violations primarily subject to fines or administrative sanctions.

2. The classification of an offence determines the applicable penalties and the competent judicial authority.

3. The Sovereign may, by decree, reclassify an offence where the protection of the State or public order so requires.
