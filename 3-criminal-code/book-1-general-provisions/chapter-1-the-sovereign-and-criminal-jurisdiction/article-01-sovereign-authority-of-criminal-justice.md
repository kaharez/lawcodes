# Article 1 – Sovereign Authority of Criminal Justice

1. Criminal justice in the State of Kaharagia is administered in the Name of The Sovereign, who is the fountain of law and guardian of the public order of the State.

2. Criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the High Court of Kaharagia and by magistrates acting under its delegation, independent in judgment but bound to the Constitution and the laws of the State.

3. The authority to define offences, impose penalties, and grant pardon or commutation derives from the Sovereign and is exercised in accordance with this Code.

4. Every judgment or order issued in criminal matters shall bear at its heading the formula:
“In the Name of The Sovereign.”

5. The omission of this formula does not invalidate a judgment, but the Registrar shall correct the omission before publication.
