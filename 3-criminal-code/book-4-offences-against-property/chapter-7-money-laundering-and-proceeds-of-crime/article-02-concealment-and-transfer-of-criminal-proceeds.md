# Article 2 – Concealment and Transfer of Criminal Proceeds

1. It is an offence to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer, or remove from the jurisdiction any property that constitutes, in whole or in part, the proceeds of criminal activity, or that is used or intended to be used to facilitate criminal activity.

2. Concealment and transfer of criminal proceeds includes:
    (a) hiding, concealing, or disguising the true nature, source, location, ownership, or control of criminal proceeds;
    (b) converting criminal proceeds into different forms of property or assets;
    (c) transferring criminal proceeds to other persons or jurisdictions;
    (d) removing or attempting to remove criminal proceeds from the jurisdiction;
    (e) using nominees, shell companies, or complex structures to conceal ownership;
    (f) commingling criminal proceeds with legitimate funds or assets;
    (g) purchasing assets or property with criminal proceeds to disguise their origin; or
    (h) providing assistance or services to facilitate concealment or transfer.

3. Concealment and transfer of criminal proceeds is punished under Penalty Band E.

4. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the criminal proceeds derive from particularly serious offences, including trafficking, terrorism, corruption, or organized crime;
    (b) the amounts involved are very substantial;
    (c) the concealment or transfer is sophisticated or involves multiple jurisdictions;
    (d) the offender is a professional advisor, financial institution employee, or person in a position of trust;
    (e) the concealment or transfer undermines financial systems or regulatory controls; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for money laundering or financial crimes.

5. It is not necessary to prove the specific predicate offence from which the proceeds were derived, only that the property constitutes proceeds of criminal activity.

6. Juridical persons may be held liable for concealment and transfer of criminal proceeds committed through their operations or by their employees and agents.

7. The court shall order confiscation of all concealed or transferred proceeds and property used in the commission of the offence.
