# Article 1 – Money Laundering

1. Money laundering is the act of converting, transferring, concealing, or disguising the proceeds of crime, or acquiring, possessing, or using such proceeds, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that they are derived from criminal activity.

2. Money laundering includes:
    (a) converting or transferring criminal proceeds for the purpose of concealing or disguising their illicit origin;
    (b) concealing or disguising the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, or ownership of criminal proceeds;
    (c) acquiring, possessing, or using property knowing or suspecting it to be proceeds of crime;
    (d) facilitating the laundering of criminal proceeds by providing services, accounts, or means for transferring or concealing such proceeds;
    (e) structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements or regulatory detection;
    (f) using front businesses, shell companies, or nominee arrangements to disguise criminal proceeds;
    (g) laundering proceeds through cryptocurrencies, digital assets, or virtual currency systems; or
    (h) any other act for the purpose of legitimizing or obscuring criminal proceeds.

3. For the purposes of this Article, "proceeds of crime" means any property, funds, or economic benefit derived from or obtained through criminal activity, whether directly or indirectly.

4. Money laundering is punished under Penalty Band E.

5. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the money laundering involves very substantial amounts;
    (b) the money laundering is systematic, sophisticated, or involves cross-border transactions;
    (c) the money laundering is committed by persons in financial, professional, or official positions;
    (d) the money laundering involves proceeds of serious crimes, including trafficking, terrorism, corruption, or organized crime;
    (e) the money laundering undermines financial systems or institutions; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for money laundering or financial crimes.

6. It is not necessary to prove the specific offence from which the criminal proceeds were derived, provided it is proved that the property constitutes proceeds of criminal activity.

7. Financial institutions, designated non-financial businesses and professions, and other reporting entities have a duty to report suspicious transactions to the competent authorities in accordance with anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to report suspicious transactions by persons under a legal duty to do so is punishable under Penalty Band C.

8. The court may order confiscation of all laundered proceeds and property used in money laundering, and may impose fines proportionate to the value laundered.

9. Juridical persons may be held liable for money laundering committed through their operations, and may be subject to dissolution, prohibition from operating in financial sectors, and confiscation of assets.
