# Article 3 – Acquisition and Use of Criminal Proceeds

1. It is an offence to acquire, possess, use, or benefit from property knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that it constitutes the proceeds of criminal activity.

2. Acquisition and use of criminal proceeds includes:
    a. acquiring property or assets with knowledge or suspicion of their criminal origin;
    b. possessing or controlling criminal proceeds;
    c. using criminal proceeds for purchases, investments, or transactions;
    d. benefiting from criminal proceeds, including through gifts, inheritance, or other transfers;
    e. living off or deriving income or benefits from criminal proceeds; or
    f. accepting payment or compensation in property known or suspected to be criminal proceeds.

3. Acquisition and use of criminal proceeds is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    a. the property acquired or used derives from serious predicate offences;
    b. the amounts or value involved are substantial;
    c. the acquisition or use is systematic or part of a pattern of conduct;
    d. the offender occupies a position that facilitated the acquisition or use;
    e. the offender took active steps to conceal the criminal origin of the property; or
    f. the offender has previous convictions for money laundering or related offences.

5. It is a defence if the accused acquired or used the property for adequate consideration and did not know and had no reasonable grounds to suspect that it constituted criminal proceeds.

6. Spouses, family members, and associates who acquire or use property known or suspected to be criminal proceeds are not exempt from prosecution under this Article, unless they can prove they acquired the property in good faith without knowledge or suspicion of its origin.

7. The court shall order confiscation of all criminal proceeds acquired, possessed, or used by the offender, and may order confiscation of property of equivalent value where the proceeds cannot be traced or have been dissipated.

8. Professional advisors, trustees, and persons in positions of responsibility who knowingly facilitate acquisition or use of criminal proceeds are subject to the penalties under this Article and professional disqualification.
