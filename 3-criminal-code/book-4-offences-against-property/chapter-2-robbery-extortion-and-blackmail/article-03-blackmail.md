# Article 3 – Blackmail

1. Blackmail is the act of making an unwarranted demand with menaces, with a view to gain for oneself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    a. a demand is unwarranted unless the person making it believes they have reasonable grounds for making the demand and believes that the use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand;
    b. "menaces" includes threats of any action detrimental or harmful to the person threatened, including threats to expose information, bring accusations, or take action causing embarrassment, harm, or disadvantage; and
    c. it is immaterial whether the menaces relate to action to be taken by the person making the demand or by another person.

3. Blackmail includes:
    a. threatening to expose secrets, private information, or embarrassing facts unless payment or benefits are provided;
    b. threatening to make accusations of criminal or immoral conduct unless demands are met;
    c. threatening to distribute intimate images or information (which may also constitute an offence under Book 3, Chapter 6, Article 8);
    d. threatening to cause economic, reputational, or professional harm unless demands are met; or
    e. any other threat to cause harm or disadvantage made with a view to compelling compliance with demands.

4. Blackmail is punished under Penalty Band D.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    a. the blackmail is systematic or involves multiple victims;
    b. the blackmail causes severe psychological harm, economic loss, or reputational damage;
    c. the blackmail involves threats related to children or vulnerable persons;
    d. the blackmail exploits a position of trust, authority, or professional relationship;
    e. the blackmail involves substantial demands or is prolonged over an extended period; or
    f. the offender has previous convictions for blackmail or related offences.

6. It is not a defence that the information or accusations are true, or that the person making the demand believes they have a genuine grievance.

7. Blackmail is complete when the demand with menaces is made, whether or not the demand is complied with or the threatened action is carried out.
