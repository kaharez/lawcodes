# Article 2 – Extortion

1. Extortion is the act of compelling another person to deliver property, provide a benefit, or take or refrain from taking any action, by means of threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority.

2. Extortion includes:
    a. demanding property or benefits through threats of violence to the victim or any other person;
    b. demanding property or benefits through threats to damage property, reputation, or economic interests;
    c. demanding property or benefits through threats to expose embarrassing, damaging, or private information;
    d. demanding property or benefits through abuse of official authority or position;
    e. demanding property or benefits through threats of legal action, deportation, or other adverse official action, where such threats are made dishonestly or in bad faith; or
    f. demanding property or benefits through threats to withhold services, protection, or benefits to which the victim is entitled.

3. Extortion is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    a. the extortion involves threats of serious violence or death;
    b. the extortion is committed by an organized group or criminal enterprise engaged in systematic extortion;
    c. the victim is particularly vulnerable or in a position of dependency;
    d. the extortion involves substantial value or repeated demands;
    e. the extortion is committed by a public official or person in a position of authority;
    f. the extortion causes serious harm, distress, or economic loss to the victim; or
    g. the offender has previous convictions for extortion or related offences.

5. It is not necessary that the threat be carried out or that the victim actually delivers property or benefits, provided the demand was made with the intention of compelling the victim through the threat.

6. Where extortion involves sexual demands or exploitation, the provisions of Book 3, Chapter 6 also apply.
