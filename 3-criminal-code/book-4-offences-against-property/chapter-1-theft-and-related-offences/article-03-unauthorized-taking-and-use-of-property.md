# Article 3 – Unauthorized Taking and Use of Property

1. It is an offence to take, use, or operate movable property belonging to another without the owner's consent, without the intention of permanently depriving the owner, but with the intention of temporarily using or depriving the owner of possession.

2. This offence includes:
    a. unauthorized taking of a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other means of transport (commonly known as "joyriding");
    b. unauthorized use of a computer system, digital device, or network;
    c. unauthorized use of equipment, machinery, or tools belonging to another;
    d. unauthorized taking and use of animals; or
    e. any other temporary appropriation of property for use without consent.

3. Unauthorized taking and use is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    a. the unauthorized taking causes damage to the property;
    b. the property is not returned or is returned in a damaged or diminished condition;
    c. the unauthorized taking places the owner or others at risk of harm;
    d. the unauthorized taking involves a vehicle or equipment used for dangerous purposes;
    e. the unauthorized taking is committed by multiple persons acting in concert; or
    f. the offender has previous convictions for unauthorized taking or theft.

5. Where the unauthorized taking is accompanied by an intention to permanently deprive the owner, the offence constitutes theft under Article 1 of this Chapter.

6. Where the unauthorized taking involves damage to the property, the offence may be charged together with damage to property under Chapter 6 of this Book.

7. It is a defence if the accused honestly believed they had lawful authority or the owner's consent to take or use the property.
