# Article 1 – Theft

1. Theft is the unlawful appropriation of movable property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of that property.

2. Appropriation includes taking, using, disposing of, transferring, or exercising rights of ownership over property without the consent of the owner.

3. Property belongs to another if that person has possession, control, or any proprietary right or interest in the property, even if the offender has some right or interest in the same property.

4. Theft is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the theft is committed against a vulnerable person, including a child, elderly person, or person with disability;
    b. the value of the stolen property is substantial;
    c. the theft is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority over the victim;
    d. the theft is committed in circumstances of emergency, disaster, or public crisis;
    e. the stolen property is of particular cultural, historical, or sentimental value;
    f. the theft involves multiple victims or is part of a systematic scheme;
    g. the theft is committed by an employee, agent, or person entrusted with the property; or
    h. the offender has previous convictions for theft or property offences.

6. Theft includes:
    a. theft by finding, where a person appropriates property that has been lost or abandoned without taking reasonable steps to find the owner;
    b. theft of services, including dishonestly obtaining services without payment or intending to avoid payment;
    c. theft of digital assets, including cryptocurrency, digital tokens, or other intangible property with economic value;
    d. theft by deception, where appropriation is achieved through false representation (which may also constitute fraud under Chapter 4 of this Book);
    e. theft from a person, including pickpocketing or snatching property from a person's possession; or
    f. shoplifting or theft from commercial premises.

7. It is a defence if:
    a. the accused honestly believed they had a legal right to the property;
    b. the accused honestly believed the owner would have consented to the appropriation in the circumstances;
    c. the accused took the property with the intention of preventing immediate harm and returned it or took reasonable steps to return it; or
    d. where the property is an animal, the accused took the animal to prevent immediate and serious suffering, cruelty, or violation of the animal's welfare as established under Book III, Chapter 8 of the Civil Code or Book V, Chapter 6 of this Code, and promptly reported the matter to competent authorities and surrendered the animal to appropriate care.

8. Notwithstanding paragraph 7(d), the taking of an animal does not constitute a complete defence where the accused failed to report to authorities within 24 hours or acted with ulterior motive beyond animal welfare. In such cases, the court may reduce or suspend penalties in recognition of the animal welfare motive.

9. Where theft is committed with violence or threat of violence, the offence constitutes robbery under Chapter 2 of this Book.

10. For the purposes of this Article, animals are treated as movable property subject to the special provisions and defences established in paragraphs 7(d) and 8, which recognize the sentience of animals and the duty of care owed to them under the Civil Code.
