# Article 2 – Receiving Stolen Property

1. It is an offence to dishonestly receive, retain, remove, dispose of, or realize stolen property, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the property is stolen.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    (a) "stolen property" includes property obtained by theft, robbery, burglary, fraud, embezzlement, or any other unlawful appropriation;
    (b) "receiving" includes acquiring possession, control, or any interest in the property;
    (c) "retaining" includes continuing to possess or control property after becoming aware it is stolen; and
    (d) property is treated as stolen until it is restored to the owner or lawful possessor, or until ownership or possession is otherwise lawfully determined.

3. Receiving stolen property is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the value of the stolen property is substantial;
    (b) the receiving is part of a systematic scheme or criminal enterprise;
    (c) the receiver operates a business or premises for the purpose of receiving stolen property;
    (d) the receiver deals in stolen property on a commercial scale;
    (e) the stolen property is of particular cultural, historical, or public importance; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for receiving stolen property.

5. It is not necessary to prove the identity of the thief or the specific offence by which the property was stolen, provided it is proved that the property was stolen and the accused knew or had reasonable grounds to believe it was stolen.

6. Evidence that the accused was found in possession of recently stolen property, or that the accused purchased or acquired the property for a price substantially below market value, or in suspicious circumstances, may be considered in determining whether the accused knew or had reasonable grounds to believe the property was stolen.

7. It is a defence if the accused received or retained the property with the intention of restoring it to the owner or delivering it to lawful authorities.
