1. It is an offence to intentionally and without authorization access a computer system, network, database, or digital device belonging to another person or entity.

2. Unauthorized access includes:
    (a) accessing a system by circumventing security measures, authentication, or access controls;
    (b) exceeding authorized access by accessing areas, data, or functions beyond the scope of authorization;
    (c) using stolen, obtained, or guessed credentials to access systems;
    (d) exploiting vulnerabilities or security flaws to gain unauthorized access;
    (e) maintaining unauthorized access or creating backdoors for future access; or
    (f) facilitating unauthorized access by providing tools, credentials, or assistance to others.

3. This Article applies to unauthorized access to:
    (a) private computer systems, networks, and devices;
    (b) commercial, business, or corporate systems;
    (c) financial systems and banking infrastructure;
    (d) any computer system, regardless of location, where the offender is a national or Verified Kaharagian; and
    (e) State systems, which are subject to more severe penalties under Book 2, Chapter III.

4. Unauthorized access to private or commercial systems is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the unauthorized access is for the purpose of committing fraud, theft, or other property crimes;
    (b) the unauthorized access results in damage, loss, or disruption;
    (c) the unauthorized access involves obtaining, disclosing, or misusing confidential or sensitive data;
    (d) the unauthorized access is systematic or part of organized criminal activity;
    (e) the unauthorized access affects critical infrastructure, financial systems, or systems serving the public; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for cybercrime.

6. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the system had inadequate security measures;
    (b) no damage or loss resulted from the access;
    (c) the offender did not profit from the access; or
    (d) the access occurred from outside the territory of any State.

7. Where unauthorized access also constitutes theft, fraud, or other offences, those provisions apply in addition to this Article.
