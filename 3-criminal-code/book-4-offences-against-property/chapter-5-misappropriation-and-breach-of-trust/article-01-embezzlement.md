2. Embezzlement includes:
    (a) appropriating money, property, or assets belonging to an employer, client, or principal;
    (b) diverting funds or property for personal use or benefit;
    (c) converting property held in trust or fiduciary capacity to one's own use;
    (d) misappropriating public funds or property by a person holding public office or employment; or
    (e) dishonestly dealing with property entrusted for safekeeping, administration, or specific purposes.

3. Embezzlement is punished under Penalty Band D.

    (a) the embezzled amount or value is substantial;
    (b) the embezzlement is systematic or prolonged over an extended period;
    (c) the embezzlement is committed by a person in a senior position of trust or authority;
    (d) the embezzlement involves public funds or property;
