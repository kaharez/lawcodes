# Article 5 – Forced Marriage

1. Forced marriage is the act of compelling, coercing, or deceiving another person to enter into a marriage without that person's free and full consent.

2. Forced marriage includes:
    (a) using force, threats, intimidation, or violence to compel a person to marry;
    (b) using coercion, undue pressure, psychological manipulation, or abuse of authority to compel a person to marry;
    (c) deceiving a person as to the nature of a ceremony or the consequences of participation;
    (d) exploiting a person's vulnerability, dependency, age, or lack of capacity to obtain acquiescence to marriage;
    (e) arranging, facilitating, or participating in a marriage where the person does not give free and full consent;
    (f) taking or causing a person to be taken to another jurisdiction for the purpose of forced marriage; or
    (g) attempting, conspiring, or aiding another to commit any of the foregoing acts.

3. For the purposes of this Article, consent is not free and full where it is obtained by force, threats, coercion, undue influence, deception, or exploitation of vulnerability.

4. A person under the age of eighteen years cannot give valid consent to marriage except where marriage is lawfully authorized by the Sovereign in exceptional circumstances, as provided in the Civil Code.

5. Forced marriage is punished under Penalty Band E.

6. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the victim is a child under the age of sixteen years;
    (b) the forced marriage involves trafficking or removal of the victim across borders;
    (c) the forced marriage is accompanied by violence, confinement, or severe abuse;
    (d) the victim suffers serious physical or psychological harm;
    (e) the forced marriage is perpetrated by parents, guardians, or persons exercising authority over the victim;
    (f) the forced marriage leads to further abuse, exploitation, or harm; or
    (g) multiple victims are subjected to forced marriage by an organized scheme or network.

7. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the marriage is recognized or lawful under the law of another jurisdiction;
    (b) the forced marriage is sanctioned by cultural, religious, or traditional practices;
    (c) the victim's family approved or arranged the marriage;
    (d) the victim initially acquiesced or did not resist; or
    (e) the marriage was subsequently consummated or continued.

8. Any person who aids, abets, facilitates, or arranges a forced marriage is guilty of an offence punishable under Penalty Band D.

9. A marriage entered into without free and full consent is voidable under the Civil Code, and the court may annul such marriage upon petition by the victim or by the competent authorities.

10. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered where forced marriage is committed with grave abusive or exploitative circumstances.
