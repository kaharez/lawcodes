# Article 1 – Domestic Abuse and Violence

1. Domestic abuse is any act of physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, or economic violence, coercion, or control committed against a person with whom the offender has or has had a domestic relationship.

2. For the purposes of this Chapter, a "domestic relationship" includes:
    a. marriage, civil union, or registered partnership, whether current or former;
    b. intimate or romantic relationship, whether current or former, including dating relationships and cohabitation;
    c. family relationship by consanguinity, affinity, or adoption, including parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins, and in-laws;
    d. guardianship, care, or custodial relationship; or
    e. any other relationship of a domestic or family character as defined by law or recognized by the court.

3. Domestic abuse includes:
    a. physical violence, including assault, battery, or infliction of bodily harm;
    b. sexual violence or abuse, as defined in Book 3, Chapter 6;
    c. psychological or emotional abuse, including threats, intimidation, humiliation, degradation, or isolation;
    d. economic abuse, including controlling financial resources, preventing access to money or employment, or creating economic dependency;
    e. coercive control, as defined in Article 2 of this Chapter;
    f. stalking or harassment, as defined in Book 2, Chapter 5, Article 2 and Book 3, Chapter 6, Article 10; or
    g. any conduct that causes physical, psychological, sexual, or economic harm or suffering to the victim.

4. Where domestic abuse consists of acts that constitute offences under other provisions of this Code, including homicide, assault, sexual offences, or unlawful detention, those provisions apply, and the domestic relationship shall be considered an aggravating circumstance.

5. Domestic abuse that does not constitute another specific offence but consists of a pattern of controlling, threatening, or harmful conduct is punished under Penalty Band C.

6. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the abuse is severe, prolonged, or systematic;
    b. the victim is a child, elderly person, or particularly vulnerable person;
    c. the abuse occurs in the presence of children;
    d. the abuse results in serious physical or psychological harm;
    e. the offender has previously been convicted of domestic abuse or violence;
    f. the abuse involves use of weapons or objects to inflict harm; or
    g. the offender violated a protection order or judicial directive.

7. No cultural, religious, or social justification shall be recognized as a defence to domestic abuse.

8. The court may issue protection orders, restraining orders, or other measures to safeguard the victim and prevent further abuse, in accordance with procedures established by law.
