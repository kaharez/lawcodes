# Article 3 – Child Abuse and Neglect

1. For the purposes of this Article, "child" means any person under the age of eighteen years, as defined in the Civil Code.

2. Child abuse is any act or failure to act by a parent, guardian, person exercising parental authority, or person in a position of trust or care over a child, which causes or creates a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or psychological harm to the child.

3. Child abuse includes:
    (a) inflicting physical injury, pain, or impairment upon a child;
    (b) sexual abuse or exploitation, as defined in Book 3, Chapter 6;
    (c) emotional or psychological abuse, including verbal abuse, humiliation, rejection, or terrorizing the child;
    (d) exposing the child to domestic violence or abuse between household members;
    (e) using excessive or cruel punishment or discipline;
    (f) confining, restraining, or isolating a child in a manner that causes suffering or harm; or
    (g) exploiting the child for labour, begging, criminal activity, or other harmful purposes.

4. Child neglect is the persistent or severe failure by a parent, guardian, or person responsible for a child to provide for the child's basic physical, emotional, medical, or educational needs, resulting in harm or substantial risk of harm to the child.

5. Child neglect includes:
    (a) failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or hygiene;
    (b) failure to provide necessary medical care or treatment;
    (c) failure to provide education or allow the child to attend school;
    (d) failure to protect the child from harm or exposure to dangerous conditions;
    (e) abandoning the child or failing to provide supervision appropriate to the child's age and needs; or
    (f) failure to provide emotional care, stability, or support necessary for the child's development.

6. Child abuse is punished under Penalty Band D.

7. Child neglect is punished under Penalty Band C.

8. The penalty for child abuse or neglect is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the abuse or neglect results in serious physical injury, permanent impairment, or death;
    (b) the abuse or neglect is severe, prolonged, or systematic;
    (c) the abuse involves torture, cruelty, or sadistic conduct;
    (d) the child is of particularly young age or is particularly vulnerable due to disability or other factors;
    (e) multiple children are abused or neglected;
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for child abuse or neglect; or
    (g) the abuse or neglect is committed for purposes of exploitation, financial gain, or gratification.

9. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the conduct was intended as discipline or correction;
    (b) the conduct is justified by cultural, religious, or traditional practices;
    (c) the child consented to or did not object to the conduct;
    (d) the child was not the offender's biological child; or
    (e) the offender was also a victim of abuse.

10. Corporal punishment of a child that causes injury, pain, or humiliation, or that is excessive or cruel in the circumstances, constitutes child abuse under this Article.

11. Any person who knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is being abused or neglected has a duty to report the matter to the competent authorities. Failure to report by persons in positions of responsibility over children, including teachers, medical professionals, social workers, and child care providers, is punishable under Penalty Band B.

12. Where child abuse or neglect also constitutes homicide, assault, sexual offences, or other specific offences under this Code, those provisions apply with the family relationship as an aggravating circumstance.
