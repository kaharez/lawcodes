# Article 4 – Elder Abuse and Abuse of Vulnerable Family Members

1. Elder abuse is any act or failure to act by a person in a family, domestic, or care relationship with an elderly person that causes harm, distress, or risk of harm to that person.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    a. "elderly person" means a person who has attained the age of sixty-five years or who, by reason of advanced age, is in a position of particular vulnerability;
    b. "vulnerable family member" means any adult family member who, by reason of age, illness, disability, mental or physical impairment, or dependency, is in a position of particular vulnerability; and
    c. the provisions of this Article apply to abuse committed by family members, caregivers, persons exercising authority or guardianship, or persons in a domestic or custodial relationship with the victim.

3. Elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable family members includes:
    a. physical abuse, including assault, battery, inappropriate restraint, or infliction of pain or injury;
    b. sexual abuse or exploitation, as defined in Book 3, Chapter 6;
    c. psychological or emotional abuse, including intimidation, humiliation, threats, or isolation;
    d. financial or economic abuse, including theft, fraud, misappropriation of funds or property, coercion to sign documents, or exploitation of assets or benefits;
    e. neglect, including failure to provide necessary care, medical treatment, nutrition, hygiene, or safe living conditions;
    f. abandonment or desertion of the person in need of care; or
    g. deprivation of liberty or autonomy beyond what is necessary for the person's safety or wellbeing.

4. Abuse of a vulnerable family member that does not fall within another specific offence is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the abuse results in serious physical or psychological harm;
    b. the abuse is prolonged, systematic, or severe;
    c. the victim is in a state of complete or near-complete dependency on the offender;
    d. the abuse involves financial exploitation of substantial assets or benefits;
    e. the abuse involves multiple victims;
    f. the offender holds a position of legal authority, guardianship, or professional care over the victim; or
    g. the offender has previous convictions for abuse of vulnerable persons.

6. Where the abuse also constitutes homicide, assault, theft, fraud, sexual offences, or other specific offences under this Code, those provisions apply with the family relationship and vulnerability as aggravating circumstances.

7. Any person who, in the course of professional duties involving the care or protection of elderly or vulnerable persons, knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect abuse has a duty to report the matter to the competent authorities. Failure to report is punishable under Penalty Band B.

8. It is not a defence that:
    a. the conduct was necessary for the care or control of the victim;
    b. the victim consented to or did not object to the conduct;
    c. the victim lacks legal capacity;
    d. the offender had legal authority over the victim's affairs; or
    e. the conduct is justified by cultural, religious, or family norms.

9. The court may order restitution, removal of the offender from any position of authority or guardianship, and protective measures to safeguard the victim.
