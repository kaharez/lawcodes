# Article 8 – Violation of Protection Orders

1. It is an offence to knowingly violate, breach, or fail to comply with a protection order, restraining order, or any judicial order issued for the protection of a person from domestic abuse, family violence, harassment, stalking, or other harmful conduct.

2. Violation of a protection order includes:
    (a) contacting, communicating with, or approaching the protected person in breach of the order;
    (b) attending or remaining at a place where the protected person resides, works, studies, or regularly visits, in breach of the order;
    (c) threatening, intimidating, or harassing the protected person or any person specified in the order;
    (d) damaging or interfering with the property of the protected person;
    (e) using any means, including digital, electronic, or third-party intermediaries, to contact or monitor the protected person in breach of the order;
    (f) failing to surrender weapons, vacate premises, or comply with any other condition imposed by the order; or
    (g) inducing, encouraging, or causing another person to violate the order on the offender's behalf.

3. Violation of a protection order is punished under Penalty Band C.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    (a) the violation is accompanied by violence, threats, or intimidation;
    (b) the violation causes fear, distress, or harm to the protected person;
    (c) the offender has previously violated the same or another protection order;
    (d) the violation occurs in circumstances where the protected person is particularly vulnerable;
    (e) the violation involves use of weapons or dangerous instruments;
    (f) the violation involves breach of multiple conditions of the order; or
    (g) the violation is persistent or systematic.

5. Where the violation also constitutes another offence, including assault, harassment, stalking, unlawful detention, or property damage, both offences apply, and the penalties may be cumulated.

6. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the protected person consented to or invited the contact or conduct;
    (b) the protected person initiated contact with the offender;
    (c) the offender claims a legitimate reason for the contact or presence;
    (d) the order was obtained in civil proceedings rather than criminal proceedings; or
    (e) the offender disputes the validity or justification of the order.

7. Any challenge to the validity or scope of a protection order must be made through appropriate legal procedures and does not constitute a defence to a charge of violation.

8. The court may issue or extend protection orders, increase penalties, or impose additional conditions to safeguard the protected person where a violation has occurred.

9. Law enforcement authorities shall have the power to arrest without warrant any person reasonably suspected of violating a protection order where there is reason to believe the person poses an immediate risk to the protected person.
