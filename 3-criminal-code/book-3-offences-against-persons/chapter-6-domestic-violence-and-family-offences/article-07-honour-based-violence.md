# Article 7 – Honour-Based Violence

1. Honour-based violence is any act of violence, coercion, abuse, or control committed against a person by family members or community members for the purported purpose of protecting or restoring the honour, reputation, or social standing of a family, community, or group.

2. Honour-based violence includes:
    (a) physical violence, including assault, battery, or homicide committed in the name of honour;
    (b) forced marriage, as defined in Article 5 of this Chapter;
    (c) forced isolation, confinement, or restriction of liberty;
    (d) forced abortion or forced pregnancy;
    (e) threats, intimidation, or coercion to conform to cultural or religious practices;
    (f) ostracism, expulsion from family or community, or denial of economic support as punishment;
    (g) female genital mutilation, as defined in Article 6 of this Chapter;
    (h) punitive measures imposed for refusal to marry, choice of spouse, sexual conduct, gender identity, religious conversion, or other exercise of personal autonomy;
    (i) violence or punishment for perceived transgression of social, cultural, or religious norms; or
    (j) collective or family-sanctioned punishment for individual conduct.

3. Where honour-based violence constitutes another specific offence under this Code, including homicide, assault, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, unlawful detention, or sexual offences, those provisions apply, and the honour-based motivation shall be considered an aggravating circumstance.

4. Honour-based violence that does not constitute another specific offence but involves threats, coercion, or abuse for purposes of controlling or punishing a person in the name of honour is punished under Penalty Band D.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the violence results in serious physical or psychological harm;
    (b) the violence involves multiple perpetrators or collective family or community action;
    (c) the violence is directed against a child or particularly vulnerable person;
    (d) the violence involves killing or attempted killing ("honour killing");
    (e) the violence involves prolonged or systematic abuse;
    (f) the violence involves forced marriage, female genital mutilation, or other grave violations; or
    (g) the violence results in the victim's death, serious injury, or forced banishment.

6. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the violence was committed to restore family or community honour;
    (b) the victim's conduct violated cultural, religious, or traditional norms;
    (c) the violence was sanctioned or approved by family or community members;
    (d) the violence was committed in response to the victim's exercise of personal autonomy, including choice of marriage, dress, religion, or lifestyle;
    (e) the victim provoked or deserved the violence; or
    (f) the violence is customary or accepted in the offender's culture or community.

7. Any person who aids, abets, encourages, or assists in honour-based violence, or who fails to protect a person at risk of honour-based violence despite having authority or responsibility to do so, is guilty of an offence punishable under Penalty Band D.

8. Where honour-based violence results in homicide, the offence constitutes aggravated homicide, and the court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered.

9. The court shall order protective measures for victims or persons at risk of honour-based violence, including protection orders, safe accommodation, and prohibition of contact with perpetrators.

10. The State shall take all necessary measures to prevent, protect against, and educate the population about the unlawfulness and harm of honour-based violence.
