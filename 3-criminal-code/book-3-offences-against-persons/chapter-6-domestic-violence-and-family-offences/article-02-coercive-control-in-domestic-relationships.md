# Article 2 – Coercive Control in Domestic Relationships

1. Coercive control is a persistent pattern of controlling, regulating, isolating, exploiting, or degrading behavior directed at a person with whom the offender has a domestic relationship, which causes the victim serious alarm, distress, or fear, or which has a substantial adverse effect on the victim's autonomy, liberty, or wellbeing.

2. Coercive control includes, but is not limited to:
    (a) isolating the victim from friends, family, or support networks;
    (b) controlling, regulating, or monitoring the victim's daily activities, movements, communications, or contacts;
    (c) depriving the victim of access to financial resources, employment, education, or means of independence;
    (d) repeatedly humiliating, degrading, or undermining the victim's sense of self-worth;
    (e) making threats of violence, harm, or adverse consequences to the victim or persons close to the victim;
    (f) regulating or controlling the victim's appearance, behavior, or choices;
    (g) restricting the victim's access to transportation, communication, or essential services;
    (h) using children to control or coerce the victim, including threats related to custody or contact;
    (i) destroying or damaging the victim's property or possessions as a means of intimidation;
    (j) exploiting the victim's vulnerability, including immigration status, disability, or dependency; or
    (k) gaslighting, manipulating, or distorting reality to make the victim doubt their own perception or sanity.

3. Coercive control is punished under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the coercive control results in serious physical or psychological harm to the victim;
    (b) the coercive control is accompanied by violence or threats of violence;
    (c) the victim is particularly vulnerable due to age, disability, pregnancy, immigration status, or other factors;
    (d) the coercive control involves children or occurs in the presence of children;
    (e) the coercive control is prolonged and systematic over an extended period; or
    (f) the offender has previous convictions for domestic abuse or coercive control.

5. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the victim did not attempt to leave the relationship or seek help;
    (b) the victim participated in some activities or made some decisions voluntarily;
    (c) no single act of abuse would independently constitute an offence; or
    (d) the conduct is justified by cultural, religious, or social norms.

6. Evidence of coercive control may include testimony from the victim, evidence of controlling behavior, communications, financial records, witness testimony, and expert evidence on the dynamics of coercive relationships.

7. The court may issue protection orders and other measures to safeguard the victim's autonomy, safety, and wellbeing.
