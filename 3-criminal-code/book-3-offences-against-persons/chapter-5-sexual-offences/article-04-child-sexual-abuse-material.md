# Article 4 – Child Sexual Abuse Material

1. Child sexual abuse material means any visual, audio, or textual representation, by any means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activity, or any representation of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes.

2. For the purposes of this Article, "child" means any person under the age of eighteen years, or any person depicted or represented as being under the age of eighteen years.

3. The following acts constitute offences punishable under Penalty Band E:
    (a) producing, creating, or manufacturing child sexual abuse material;
    (b) distributing, disseminating, transmitting, or making available child sexual abuse material;
    (c) offering, advertising, or promoting child sexual abuse material;
    (d) procuring or obtaining child sexual abuse material for oneself or another;
    (e) knowingly possessing or accessing child sexual abuse material;
    (f) knowingly facilitating, enabling, or providing technical means for any of the foregoing acts; or
    (g) financing or profiting from the production or distribution of child sexual abuse material.

4. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the material was created, possessed, or accessed outside the territory of any State;
    (b) the child depicted consented to the creation of the material;
    (c) no actual child was harmed in the creation of simulated material, where the material realistically depicts a child; or
    (d) the material was possessed for personal use only.

5. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the material depicts a child under the age of fourteen years;
    (b) the material depicts serious sexual violence, torture, or cruelty;
    (c) the offence is committed for commercial purposes or financial gain;
    (d) the offence involves a large quantity of material or systematic activity;
    (e) the offender occupies a position of trust, authority, or care over children; or
    (f) the offender is involved in the production or commissioning of new material.

6. Possession of a small quantity of material, where the possessor voluntarily reports the material to authorities and cooperates fully in any investigation, may be subject to Penalty Band D where the court is satisfied that possession was neither intentional nor for purposes of gratification.

7. Any person who, in the course of their professional duties, becomes aware of child sexual abuse material shall immediately report it to the competent authorities and shall not be prosecuted under this Article for possession arising solely from such discovery, provided they take no action to retain, distribute, or use the material beyond that required for reporting and cooperation with authorities.
