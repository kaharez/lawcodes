1. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that violates the dignity, autonomy, or psychological integrity of another person.

2. Sexual harassment includes:
    (a) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, or other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature;
    (b) creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment of a sexual nature;
    (c) making sexual remarks, comments, or gestures that cause offence, humiliation, or distress;
    (d) displaying, sending, or transmitting sexually explicit material or images without consent;
    (e) making unwanted physical contact of a sexual nature that does not amount to sexual assault under Article 2 of this Chapter; or
    (f) persistently engaging in unwanted communication or contact of a sexual nature after being requested to desist.

3. Sexual harassment is punished under Penalty Band B.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band C where:
    (a) the harassment is committed by a person in a position of authority, employment, or professional relationship over the victim;
    (b) the harassment is persistent, systematic, or creates a severe hostile environment;
    (c) the victim is a child, vulnerable person, or person in a position of dependency;
    (d) the harassment is accompanied by threats, intimidation, or abuse of power;
    (e) the harassment results in serious psychological harm or forces the victim to leave employment, education, or residence; or
    (f) the harassment occurs in the workplace, educational institution, or other setting where the victim cannot easily avoid the offender.

5. Sexual coercion is the use of threats, intimidation, blackmail, abuse of authority, or exploitation of vulnerability to compel another person to engage in sexual activity or submit to sexual advances.

6. Sexual coercion is punished under Penalty Band D, without prejudice to more severe penalties for rape or sexual assault where applicable.

7. Coercive control of a sexual nature within an intimate or family relationship, consisting of a persistent pattern of controlling, isolating, degrading, or abusive behavior that includes sexual domination, deprivation of sexual autonomy, or forced sexual conduct, is punished under Penalty Band D.

8. The penalty for sexual coercion or coercive control is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    (a) the victim is a child or particularly vulnerable person;
    (b) the coercion results in serious physical or psychological harm;
    (c) the coercion involves multiple victims or is part of an organized scheme; or
    (d) the coercion is accompanied by violence, threats of violence, or severe abuse.

9. For the purposes of this Article, it is immaterial whether the conduct occurs in person or through digital, electronic, or remote means.
