# Article 6 – Sexual Exploitation

1. Sexual exploitation is the act of taking advantage of another person for sexual purposes through abuse of power, vulnerability, or trust, or through coercion, deception, or the giving or receiving of benefits.

2. Sexual exploitation includes:
    a. procuring, inducing, recruiting, or facilitating another person to engage in prostitution or sexual services;
    b. profiting from, controlling, or directing the prostitution or sexual services of another person;
    c. maintaining, managing, or operating a place for the purpose of prostitution or sexual exploitation;
    d. coercing, deceiving, or manipulating another person into providing sexual services;
    e. exploiting a person's vulnerability, dependency, or economic need to obtain sexual services or benefits; or
    f. trafficking persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation, as further defined in Book 3, Chapter 2, Article 6.

3. Where the exploited person is a child under the age of eighteen years, consent is irrelevant and the offence is punished under Penalty Band E.

4. Where the exploited person is an adult, sexual exploitation is punished under Penalty Band D.

5. It is not an offence for a person to engage in prostitution voluntarily, but it is an offence to:
    a. purchase or attempt to purchase sexual services from a child under the age of eighteen years (Penalty Band E);
    b. purchase sexual services from any person where the purchaser knows or ought reasonably to know that the person is exploited, coerced, or trafficked (Penalty Band D);
    c. advertise, facilitate, or profit from the sexual exploitation of another person (Penalty Band D); or
    d. operate a commercial enterprise for the purpose of sexual exploitation (Penalty Band E).

6. The penalty is aggravated where:
    a. the exploitation involves multiple victims;
    b. the exploitation is systematic, organized, or involves a criminal network;
    c. the exploitation involves trafficking across borders;
    d. the exploitation involves violence, coercion, or severe abuse;
    e. the offender holds a position of authority, trust, or dependency over the victim; or
    f. the victim suffers severe physical or psychological harm.

7. Prosecution for purchasing sexual services from an adult person who is not exploited, coerced, or trafficked is not within the scope of this Article, but may be subject to regulation under Book 5 concerning public morality and welfare.
