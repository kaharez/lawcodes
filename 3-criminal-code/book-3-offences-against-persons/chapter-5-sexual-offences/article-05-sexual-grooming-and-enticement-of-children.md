# Article 5 – Sexual Grooming and Enticement of Children

1. Sexual grooming is any deliberate action taken to establish an emotional connection or relationship with a child for the purpose of facilitating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or the production of child sexual abuse material.

2. Grooming includes:
    a. communicating with a child, by any means including digital communication, for sexual purposes;
    b. exposing a child to sexual content, language, or conduct for the purpose of normalising sexual activity or lowering the child's inhibitions;
    c. providing gifts, money, attention, or other benefits to a child or the child's family for the purpose of gaining access to the child or the child's trust;
    d. isolating or creating dependency in a child for the purpose of facilitating abuse;
    e. arranging or attempting to arrange a meeting with a child following any form of grooming conduct with the intention of committing a sexual offence; or
    f. traveling to meet a child, or causing a child to travel, with the intention of committing a sexual offence.

3. For the purposes of this Article, "child" means any person under the age of eighteen years.

4. Grooming is punished under Penalty Band D.

5. Where grooming is accompanied by any sexual act or meeting with the child, the offence is punished under Penalty Band E.

6. It is not a defence that:
    a. the offender believed the child to be of or above the age of eighteen years, unless reasonable steps were taken to ascertain age;
    b. the meeting did not take place or the sexual offence was not completed;
    c. the child was in fact an adult impersonating a child in an investigation; or
    d. the communication or conduct occurred remotely or across territorial borders.

7. Enticement of a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation, prostitution, or the production of sexual abuse material is punished under Penalty Band E.

8. The penalty is aggravated where:
    a. the child is under the age of fourteen years;
    b. the child is between fourteen and sixteen years of age;
    c. the offender occupies a position of trust, authority, or familial relationship with the child;
    d. the grooming involves multiple children;
    e. the offender is part of an organized network or group engaged in sexual exploitation; or
    f. the grooming results in actual abuse or harm to the child.
