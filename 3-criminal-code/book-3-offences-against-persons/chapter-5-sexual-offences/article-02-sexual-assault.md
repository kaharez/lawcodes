# Article 2 – Sexual Assault

1. Sexual assault is any sexual act committed against another person without that person's consent, which does not constitute rape under Article 1 of this Chapter.

2. Sexual assault includes:
    (a) intentional touching of a sexual nature of another person's body, including but not limited to the genitals, breasts, buttocks, or thighs;
    (b) compelling another person to touch the offender's body in a sexual manner;
    (c) compelling another person to engage in sexual activity with a third person; or
    (d) any sexual act that violates the sexual autonomy or dignity of another person.

3. The provisions of Article 1 concerning consent, age, mental capacity, coercion, and defences apply equally to sexual assault.

4. Sexual assault is punished under Penalty Band D.

5. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the victim is a child under the age of eighteen years;
    (b) the assault is committed by a person in a position of authority or trust over the victim;
    (c) the assault is committed with violence or threats;
    (d) the assault is committed by multiple persons acting in concert; or
    (e) the victim is particularly vulnerable due to age, disability, or other circumstances.

6. Where the victim is a child under the age of fourteen years, the offence is punished under Penalty Band E.

7. Where the victim is a child between fourteen and sixteen years of age, additional aggravating factors apply.
