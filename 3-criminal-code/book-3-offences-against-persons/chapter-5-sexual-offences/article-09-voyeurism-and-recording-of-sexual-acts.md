# Article 9 – Voyeurism and Recording of Sexual Acts

1. Voyeurism is the act of observing, recording, or enabling another to observe or record a person engaged in a private act, for the purpose of sexual gratification or to violate the person's privacy, without that person's consent.

2. For the purposes of this Article, a "private act" includes:
    a. a person in a state of undress or nudity;
    b. a person using a toilet, bathing, or engaged in other intimate bodily functions;
    c. sexual activity or sexual conduct; or
    d. any act in circumstances where the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.

3. Voyeurism includes:
    a. observing or recording a person in a private place or engaged in a private act without consent;
    b. installing, using, or adapting equipment, including cameras, recording devices, or digital means, to observe or record a person without consent;
    c. operating equipment beneath a person's clothing (upskirting, downblousing) to observe or record intimate parts of the body;
    d. secretly recording sexual activity, even if the accused is a participant in the activity; or
    e. enabling, facilitating, or permitting another person to observe or record private acts without the consent of the person observed.

4. Voyeurism is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the victim is a child under the age of eighteen years;
    b. the recording or observation is distributed, published, or shared with others;
    c. the offence is committed in a place where persons have a heightened expectation of privacy, such as a bathroom, changing room, or private residence;
    d. the offence is systematic or involves multiple victims;
    e. the offender holds a position of authority or trust over the victim; or
    f. the recording is used for purposes of extortion, blackmail, or further exploitation.

6. It is not a defence that:
    a. the observation or recording occurred in a public place, if the victim had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the specific act or area of the body observed;
    b. the accused had a relationship with the victim; or
    c. the victim was unaware of the observation or recording.

7. The recording or observation of sexual activity without the knowledge and consent of all participants is punishable under this Article, regardless of the accused's participation in the activity.

8. It is a defence if the accused reasonably believed that the person consented to the observation or recording, provided the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain consent.
