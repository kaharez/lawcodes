# Article 1 – Rape

1. Rape is the act of sexual penetration committed against another person without that person's consent.

2. Sexual penetration includes:
    a. penetration, however slight, of the vagina or anus by any part of the body or any object; or
    b. penetration of the mouth by the penis.

3. Consent is not present where:
    a. the victim expressly refuses or resists;
    b. the victim is unable to consent due to unconsciousness, sleep, or the administration of any substance;
    c. the victim is intoxicated to the degree that they are unable to understand the nature or consequences of the act or unable to communicate refusal;
    d. the victim is under the age of eighteen years;
    e. the victim lacks the mental capacity to understand the nature of the act;
    f. consent is obtained by force, threat of force, coercion, fraud as to the nature of the act, or impersonation;
    g. the victim is in a state of particular vulnerability known to the offender and exploited to obtain acquiescence; or
    h. consent is obtained by abuse of authority, trust, or a position of power or dependency.

4. For the purposes of paragraph 3(c), intoxication includes impairment by alcohol, drugs, or any other substance, whether voluntarily or involuntarily consumed. The test is whether the victim was so affected as to be unable to understand the nature or consequences of the sexual act or unable to communicate refusal, not whether the victim was merely impaired in judgment.

5. Marriage or any existing or former relationship between the offender and the victim does not constitute consent and is not a defence to rape. This includes marriages authorized by the Sovereign where either party is under the age of eighteen years.

6. Mistake as to consent is not a defence unless the accused took reasonable steps in the circumstances to ascertain consent. Where the victim's incapacity is due to intoxication, the accused must have taken reasonable steps to ascertain both consent and capacity.

7. Rape is punished under Penalty Band E.

8. The penalty is aggravated where:
    a. the victim is a child under the age of fourteen years;
    b. the victim is a child between fourteen and sixteen years of age;
    c. the rape is committed by two or more persons acting in concert;
    d. the rape is accompanied by torture, cruelty, or results in severe physical or psychological injury;
    e. the rape is committed by a person in a position of authority or trust over the victim;
    f. the rape results in pregnancy, transmission of disease, or permanent injury; or
    g. the rape is committed against a particularly vulnerable person or in circumstances of particular helplessness.
