# Article 8 – Non-Consensual Distribution of Intimate Images

1. It is an offence to disclose, distribute, publish, or threaten to disclose a private sexual image or recording of another person without that person's consent, knowing or being reckless as to whether the person consents to the disclosure.

2. For the purposes of this Article:
    a. "private sexual image" means a still or moving image of a person in which the person is nude, partially nude, engaged in sexual activity, or depicted in a sexual manner or context, and the circumstances of creation or content give the person a reasonable expectation of privacy;
    b. "disclosure" includes transmission, publication, distribution, exhibition, or making available by any means, including digital, electronic, or online means; and
    c. it is immaterial whether the image was created with the consent of the person depicted.

3. The offence is committed where:
    a. the accused discloses the image without the consent of the person depicted;
    b. the disclosure is made intentionally or recklessly; and
    c. the accused knows or ought reasonably to know that the person depicted did not consent to the disclosure.

4. Non-consensual distribution of intimate images is punished under Penalty Band C.

5. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band D where:
    a. the disclosure is made for the purpose of causing humiliation, distress, or harm to the victim;
    b. the disclosure is made to a wide audience or through public or mass media;
    c. the image depicts a child under the age of eighteen years (which may also constitute an offence under Article 4 of this Chapter);
    d. the disclosure is accompanied by threats, extortion, or demands for money or other benefits;
    e. the offender was in a position of trust or intimate relationship with the victim; or
    f. the disclosure results in severe psychological harm or reputational damage to the victim.

6. It is a defence if:
    a. the disclosure was necessary for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, or for the purposes of legal proceedings;
    b. the disclosure was made in the public interest and was reasonable in the circumstances; or
    c. the accused reasonably believed that the person depicted had consented to the disclosure.

7. Threatening to disclose a private sexual image for the purpose of coercion, extortion, or causing distress is punishable under Penalty Band D, whether or not the threat is carried out.

8. This Article is without prejudice to more severe penalties applicable under Articles 3 or 4 of this Chapter where the image depicts a child engaged in sexual activity.
