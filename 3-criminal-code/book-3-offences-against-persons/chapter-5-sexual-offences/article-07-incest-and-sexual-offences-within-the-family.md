# Article 7 – Incest and Sexual Offences Within the Family

1. Incest is sexual penetration between persons who are related by direct lineal consanguinity, or by collateral consanguinity up to and including siblings, whether by full blood or half blood.

2. Incest is punished under Penalty Band E.

3. Where the victim is a child under the age of eighteen years, consent is irrelevant, and the penalty is aggravated.

4. Where both parties are adults and the sexual act is consensual, the court may mitigate the penalty having regard to the circumstances, but incest remains a criminal offence.

5. Any sexual act committed by a person in a parental, guardianship, or custodial role against a child in their care, regardless of biological relationship, is punished as aggravated sexual abuse under Article 3 of this Chapter.

6. The following are also punishable under this Article:
    a. sexual acts between adoptive parent and adoptive child, regardless of age (Penalty Band E);
    b. sexual acts between step-parent and step-child where a relationship of authority or dependency exists (Penalty Band E);
    c. sexual acts between persons in a familial relationship of trust or authority, including foster care or guardianship, against a minor (Penalty Band E); or
    d. sexual acts between an adult and a minor to whom the adult owes a duty of care by virtue of family relationship (Penalty Band E).

7. It is not a defence that:
    a. the parties were unaware of the biological relationship, except where both parties took all reasonable steps to ascertain the absence of relationship;
    b. the relationship was established by adoption, fostering, or other legal means rather than consanguinity; or
    c. the act occurred outside the territory of any State.

8. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered where incest is committed by an adult against a child, or where the offence demonstrates grave moral turpitude.
