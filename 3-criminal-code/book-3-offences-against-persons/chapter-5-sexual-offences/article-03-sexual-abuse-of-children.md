# Article 3 – Sexual Abuse of Children

1. Any sexual act committed against a child under the age of eighteen years constitutes sexual abuse of a child, regardless of purported consent.

2. Sexual abuse of a child includes:
    a. any act described in Articles 1 and 2 of this Chapter committed against a child;
    b. causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity;
    c. engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child for the purpose of sexual gratification or to corrupt the child;
    d. causing a child to watch sexual activity or images for the purpose of sexual gratification or to corrupt the child;
    e. arranging or facilitating the commission of any sexual offence against a child; or
    f. sexual communication with a child for the purpose of sexual gratification.

3. Where the child is under the age of fourteen years, no purported consent is of any effect whatsoever, and the offence is punished under Penalty Band E.

4. Where the child has attained the age of fourteen years but has not attained the age of sixteen years, the offence is punished under Penalty Band D, except where committed by a person in a position of authority, trust, or familial relationship with the child, in which case Penalty Band E applies.

5. Where the child has attained the age of sixteen years but has not attained the age of eighteen years, the offence is punished under Penalty Band D.

6. It is not a defence that the accused believed the child to be of or above the age of eighteen years, unless the accused:
    a. took all reasonable steps to ascertain the child's age; and
    b. had reasonable grounds to believe the child was of or above the age of eighteen years.

7. The penalty is aggravated where:
    a. the abuse is committed by a parent, guardian, or person exercising parental authority;
    b. the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust, authority, or dependency over the child, including teachers, religious leaders, coaches, care workers, or medical professionals;
    c. the abuse involves multiple children or is systematic or prolonged;
    d. the abuse is committed with violence, cruelty, or causes severe physical or psychological harm; or
    e. the abuse is recorded, photographed, or otherwise documented.
