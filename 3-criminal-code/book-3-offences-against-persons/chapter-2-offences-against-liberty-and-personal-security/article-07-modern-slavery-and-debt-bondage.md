# Article 7 – Modern Slavery and Debt Bondage

1. Slavery is the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including the power to use, manage, profit from, transfer, or dispose of that person.

2. Modern slavery includes slavery and slavery-like practices, including:
    (a) chattel slavery or ownership of persons;
    (b) debt bondage, as defined in paragraph 4 of this Article;
    (c) serfdom or feudal subjugation;
    (d) forced or compulsory labour that reduces a person to a slave-like condition;
    (e) servile marriage, where a person is transferred or inherited for matrimonial purposes without the right to refuse;
    (f) exploitation of children for labour or services in slave-like conditions; or
    (g) any practice whereby a person is treated as property or subjected to conditions analogous to slavery.

3. The following acts constitute offences punishable under Penalty Band E:
    (a) holding, keeping, or treating a person in slavery or a slavery-like condition;
    (b) exercising powers of ownership over a person;
    (c) subjecting a person to debt bondage;
    (d) trading, selling, buying, or transferring a person for any purpose;
    (e) facilitating, organizing, or profiting from slavery or slavery-like practices;
    (f) recruiting, transporting, or harbouring persons for slavery or slavery-like exploitation; or
    (g) attempting, conspiring, or aiding any of the foregoing acts.

4. Debt bondage is the status or condition arising from a pledge by a person of their personal services, or the services of a person under their control, as security for a debt, where:
    (a) the value of those services is not reasonably applied toward liquidation of the debt;
    (b) the length or nature of those services is not limited or defined; or
    (c) the person is prevented from terminating the services or leaving the employment by coercion, threat, retention of documents, or other means.

5. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the victim consented to the slavery, servitude, or debt arrangement;
    (b) the arrangement is recognized or customary in a particular culture, region, or context;
    (c) the victim received shelter, food, or other benefits;
    (d) the victim was indebted or owed obligations to the offender;
    (e) the victim did not attempt to escape or seek help; or
    (f) the slavery or bondage occurred in another jurisdiction.

6. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the victim is a child under the age of eighteen years;
    (b) multiple persons are held in slavery or bondage;
    (c) slavery or bondage is prolonged or systematic;
    (d) slavery or bondage results in serious physical or psychological harm, or death;
    (e) slavery or bondage involves sexual exploitation or severe abuse;
    (f) the offender is part of an organized criminal network engaged in slavery or trafficking; or
    (g) the offender has previous convictions for slavery, trafficking, or exploitation.

7. The court may order confiscation of all proceeds and benefits derived from slavery or bondage, full restitution and compensation to victims, and protective and rehabilitative measures for victims.

8. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered in cases of slavery or slavery-like practices involving grave abuse or systematic exploitation.

9. Victims of slavery or debt bondage shall not be penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct consequence of their enslavement, and shall be entitled to protection, support, and assistance in their recovery and reintegration.

10. Any contractual or debt obligation purportedly arising from slavery, servitude, or debt bondage is void and unenforceable.
