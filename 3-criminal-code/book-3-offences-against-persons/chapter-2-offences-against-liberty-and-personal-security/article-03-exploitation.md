# Article 3 – Exploitation

1. Exploitation is the act of taking advantage of another person through coercion, threats, deception, abuse of vulnerability, or abuse of power for the purpose of subjecting that person to forced labour, servitude, slavery, or removal of organs, or for other exploitative purposes.

2. For the purposes of this Chapter, exploitation includes but is not limited to:
    a. human trafficking, as defined in Article 6 of this Chapter;
    b. forced labour and servitude, as defined in Article 5 of this Chapter;
    c. slavery and slavery-like practices, as defined in Article 7 of this Chapter;
    d. sexual exploitation, as defined in Book 3, Chapter 6, Article 6;
    e. removal of organs or body parts for commercial or exploitative purposes;
    f. exploitation of begging, including forcing or inducing another person to beg;
    g. exploitation for criminal activity, including forcing or coercing another person to engage in theft, drug trafficking, or other criminal conduct; or
    h. economic exploitation through coercive control in circumstances not otherwise covered by specific provisions.

3. General exploitation not falling within the specific provisions of Articles 5, 6, or 7 of this Chapter, or Chapter 6, Article 6, is punishable under Penalty Band D.

4. The penalty is aggravated to Penalty Band E where:
    a. the exploitation is severe, prolonged, or systematic;
    b. the victim is a child, elderly person, or particularly vulnerable person;
    c. the exploitation involves multiple victims;
    d. the exploitation results in serious physical or psychological harm;
    e. the exploitation is committed by an organized group or criminal network; or
    f. the exploitation involves abuse of authority, trust, or official position.

5. Where exploitation also constitutes another offence under this Code, the provisions of the more specific offence shall apply, with the exploitative purpose as an aggravating circumstance.

6. Removal of organs or body parts without consent, or with consent obtained by coercion, deception, or exploitation of vulnerability, constitutes aggravated exploitation punishable under Penalty Band E, without prejudice to penalties for assault or homicide where applicable.
