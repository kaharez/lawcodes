# Article 6 – Human Trafficking

1. Human trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons by means of threat, use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or vulnerability, or giving or receiving payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

2. Exploitation for the purposes of trafficking includes:
    (a) sexual exploitation, prostitution, or other forms of sexual services;
    (b) forced labour or servitude;
    (c) slavery or slavery-like practices;
    (d) removal of organs or body parts;
    (e) forced marriage or servile marriage;
    (f) forced begging;
    (g) exploitation for criminal activity; or
    (h) any other form of exploitation that violates human dignity and autonomy.

3. The following acts constitute offences punishable under Penalty Band E:
    (a) trafficking a person for any exploitative purpose;
    (b) recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring, or receiving a person for the purpose of trafficking;
    (c) organizing, directing, or facilitating human trafficking;
    (d) profiting from, financing, or otherwise benefiting from human trafficking;
    (e) using the services of a person knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a victim of trafficking; or
    (f) attempting, conspiring, or aiding any of the foregoing acts.

4. Where the victim is a child under the age of eighteen years, the means employed (threat, force, coercion, etc.) are irrelevant, and recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of a child for exploitation constitutes trafficking regardless of consent.

5. It is not a defence that:
    (a) the victim consented to the recruitment, transportation, or harbouring;
    (b) the victim was aware of the intended exploitation;
    (c) the victim had previously engaged in prostitution or the work for which they were trafficked;
    (d) the victim received payment or other benefits;
    (e) the trafficking occurred across international borders or within a single jurisdiction;
    (f) the victim was an adult capable of consenting, where consent was obtained by improper means; or
    (g) no actual exploitation took place, where the purpose of trafficking was exploitation.

6. The penalty is aggravated where:
    (a) the victim is a child under the age of fourteen years;
    (b) trafficking results in death, serious injury, or severe physical or psychological harm;
    (c) trafficking involves multiple victims;
    (d) trafficking is committed by an organized criminal group or network;
    (e) trafficking involves abuse of official authority or position;
    (f) trafficking is accompanied by violence, torture, or cruel treatment;
    (g) trafficking involves crossing international borders or involves transnational criminal activity; or
    (h) the offender has previous convictions for trafficking or exploitation.

7. Any person who uses the services of a person for sexual exploitation, forced labour, or other exploitative purposes, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a victim of trafficking, commits an offence punishable under Penalty Band D.

8. The court may order confiscation of proceeds of trafficking, restitution and compensation to victims, and protective measures including residency permits and support services for victims.

9. The court may recommend to The Sovereign that loss of nationality be considered in cases of grave or systematic human trafficking.

10. Victims of trafficking shall not be penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct consequence of being trafficked, including immigration violations, prostitution, or other offences committed under compulsion.
